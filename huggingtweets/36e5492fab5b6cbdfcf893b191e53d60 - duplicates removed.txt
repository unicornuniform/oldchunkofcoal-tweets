Hilarious as always. You're one of the very few that have been around so long that you've not only mastered every technique of stand-up, but now you don't even have to use them. LEGEND. miss you.<|endoftext|>@cbctom I'll tell you, @cbctom, I'm one of the few there are who think Rose should never be allowed in the Hall of Fame, but I love him as much as any baseball payer, and think its a crime he doesn't do the pre-game show and its a crime Uecker doesn't call the games.<|endoftext|>Verlander pitched only one each to the first two batters.<|endoftext|>RUSSELL WILSON WITH A WILD OVERTHROW!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Rivers to Keenan Allen. Incomplete.<|endoftext|>Thank you, Gord. In what order should I read her books?<|endoftext|>So what does this all mean?<|endoftext|>I will let the TV boys take over now on ESPN. See you later and enjoy what seems like will be a horserace.<|endoftext|>I have not written a single word in a month.<|endoftext|>In this tourney, Tsitsipas has been broken 5 times, Federer once.<|endoftext|>Hahahaha. That's a very important point. Let's not forget this woman is a director.<|endoftext|>Mahomes forced to scramble but makes it with his feet.<|endoftext|>There is still 8 minutes left so the Hawks don't necessarily need a TD. They could win with two FGs and not cover.<|endoftext|>Peyton Manning is incredible. He could be a real actor and I hope he does this. Incredibly funny comic actor. Not for an athlete, for an actor.<|endoftext|>It is inside. And the 0-2 has become 3-2 and the runner will be off.<|endoftext|>@TommyBennett no problem, Tom.<|endoftext|>@AlexanderWatt I think Regis would be a great candidate to win Millionaire. His knowledge of pop culture must be insane.<|endoftext|>GIANT'S FOOTBALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND IT WILL BE REVIEWED BUT THE CALL ON THE FEILD IS NEW YORK FOOTBALL AND HARD TO THINK THAT WILL BE OVERTURNED<|endoftext|>Fouled off. Still 0-2. Bases loaded.<|endoftext|>So kind. Before they come out with the eventual reprint with actor's faces on the cover, i was considering putting some of the original hardcovers on my website. I could custom-sign them. If there is any interest, I'll do it.<|endoftext|>DJ pars. and so does Im.<|endoftext|>@ClaesLarsson7 @limolady311 Be careful. You're cruelty may be your undoing.<|endoftext|>And Federer is 40-0 just like that.<|endoftext|>TD SEATTLE AND THEY TAKE THE LEAD 17-14 AND COVER THE SPREAD BY THE HOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>A HIGH FLY BALL ALL THE WAY TO THE WARNING TRACK. BUT CAUGHT<|endoftext|>I'm sorry. That should read, " Yippie Paul Krassner is dead."<|endoftext|>After the entire team came to visit the mound Maeda is left alone to deal with the number 7 hitter, Granderson.<|endoftext|>Down to 5600. Went all-in with AA. No callers.<|endoftext|>TSIPAS SERVING FOR THE MATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Ball said into the end zone and the Eagleswith 6 minutes left, begin from its own 25.<|endoftext|>Ok, guys, Let's right a wrong and free a poor woman from an unjust sentence of 14 years. Let's get this hashtag tending. #FreeFelicity<|endoftext|>Djokovitch leads 6-0 6-2. So what does that mean for the two wagers. Namely Djoko (-7.5) and Djoko (U31.5)? Well, if Djoko wins the third, both bets win. I could go on but very little reason. Both wagers are about 30 minutes from being cash.<|endoftext|>No score in the bottom of the fifth and Arcia drives Ryu's 58th pitch deep to center. Bellinger glued to the wall, his glove extending out toward the ball, and inches short.<|endoftext|>Casey, with an uphill try from 20 feet and it is beautiful!!!!!!!!!! JUST MISSES!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Here then the second episode of QUARANTINED with special guest Chevy Chase.<|endoftext|>Yes, I loved Fat City. And The Dead as well. I will watch WiseBlood and et back to you. For now, Buster Scruggs is the film I have been bingeing on.<|endoftext|>Why do you not believe in the first two? You mean you think the dictionary got it wrong. I simply don't understand.<|endoftext|>Where can I find all the new words out there, the crazy new words necessary to identify all the differences in people. Looking for a list of those words if you guys know where I can find one.<|endoftext|>What did they bleep from Jordan's speech?<|endoftext|>But a strijkbout and the Dodgers are three outs away from extra innings.<|endoftext|>Hope you took Djoko this morning. He begins very fast with 2 breaks and leads 4-0 in the first set.<|endoftext|>A minute left in PP<|endoftext|>I worked manual labor since I was 15, and, right before I found a stage at Yuk-Yuks, I would go every morning to a place called, " temporary manpower", and would sign a piece of paper and wait for my name to be called. If it was, I'd go in front of the building and be picked up.<|endoftext|>First serve good, returned to the backhand and Rafa hits it into the net. And you have to think this is a mental issue at this point. 15-40.<|endoftext|>I know I have not posted a pick in a while. the reason is not laziness. The reason is there have been no picks. For the Superb tomorrow, I have no picks. I greatly look forward to the game, though, and placed a bet for fun.<|endoftext|>This has been the easiest Masters ever and that does not favor the veterans. Yes, Tiger is still in the mix but he would clearly prefer tough conditions where experience and creativity would become advantageous. In these easier conditions, no surprise seeing the bombers atop<|endoftext|>And I successfully jinx Finau. He misses the green.<|endoftext|>@GaryGulman Read great works of Literature out loud.If you do not understand what you are reading, stop, figure out what it means, then repeat the exercise. Do this an hour a day and in time, your own voice, your own thoughts will become the same as Tolstoy, Faulkner, Twain.<|endoftext|>Pass TO DIXON AND HE BREAKS THE PLANE!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And complete to the two for a first down.<|endoftext|>This is already the seventh they have faced in the first 20 minutes of the game. so far Lawrence is 50/50<|endoftext|>That brings up Sanchez.<|endoftext|>Pass is caught, fumbled and recovered. First and 10. Bad break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>It is 6-6, so we will go to the tie-break. Both players unbreakable so we now go to the mini-version of a set, the tie-break, where a mini-break may well determine this one.<|endoftext|>Very early on here, Djoko is challenging. he is up 30-0 in the second. Djoko has taken the first 6 points<|endoftext|>Broken-bat grounder to 3rd. Turner picks up a clumsy hit and sends it to first. GROUNDOUT!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@DjsamDani what are you talking about? that wasn't a comeback? we watched different games.<|endoftext|>I need Dan Vitale's birthday. Not the football player, the comedian and SNL player. Anybody know it?<|endoftext|>Complete over the middle. And that one will be reviewed. Pretty clear it is incomplete.<|endoftext|>FG IS GOOD. GB LEADS 24-20.<|endoftext|>Well, that's a hell of a thing for him to say, Ben. A hell of a thing.<|endoftext|>WALK AND RUN!!!!!!!!!!! 3-2 BREWERS!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>0-4 now as the pass is batted down. Surprised they didn't run it twice. 4th and 2.<|endoftext|>And a penalty is called. It is a false start. Will there be a 10 second run-off? No. I don't know why?<|endoftext|>BREAKING ALERT: CAMERON SMITH BOGEYS!!!!!!!!! AND DJ IS AHEAD BY 3 AND BY 4.<|endoftext|>VARNER MISSES AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And, so now, Rouille must break Djoko or the match is over.<|endoftext|>All caught up. Finally. And now, we are going to get the old gang together.<|endoftext|>Heremcomes the payoff pitch.<|endoftext|>After that great run, NY instantly is called for a false start to put them back to the 19, first and 15.<|endoftext|>SCHAUFELLE AT THE 9th TO JOIN THE LEAD!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I don't like how they are belittling billionaires.

Ball one.<|endoftext|>I think about Sally every night when I try to go to sleep. I think back to Caldwell's Holler and the Hell that walked down that there bridge. I wish I was the one what got killed that night. I wish it ever day.<|endoftext|>So mush to say. Such frenetic action.<|endoftext|>It's time to push for the show. A letter to Ted Sarandos is great. But watch the shows. watch over and over and over. Let's do it!!!!!!!! We can do it. Tell me when you watch ir rewatch.<|endoftext|>Baez faces Santana and the count is 2-2.<|endoftext|>And, so, Braun comes out to the plate.<|endoftext|>Mahomes is chased straight back and goes all the way back to the 40, then a brilliant scrabbling run laterally firing to the first down marker.<|endoftext|>Thats perfect, @someMarkFarrell' Hahahaha. Perfect.<|endoftext|>DeChambeau is not a champion. You can see it in their eyes. It's like Mike Tyson says, the fight is over when the two men stare at each other before the opening bell. We saw it with Wilder this weekend.<|endoftext|>Base hit up the middle.<|endoftext|>Kaymer, at the 3rd, par 3, and he has stuck it. Scott's turning what looks to rematch play, although still early.<|endoftext|>Another 3rd down for the Pack and they have a 3rd and 5 at the 10 yard line.<|endoftext|>The key holes will be the 13th and 15th, the two par 5s on the back 9. If DJ plays those two in two under, the Masters is his.<|endoftext|>shut the fuck up. you don't know a goddam thing about stand-up comedy. You sound like a guy that would vote for Trump.<|endoftext|>And just like that the total is 20 for the second half for a push and 37 for the game.<|endoftext|>why is Phil Ivey dead to Norman Chad?<|endoftext|>may take this one though.<|endoftext|>Started early slowly which was good because I took the under but now they are not missing. First quarter, Steph hits 3 Its and total gets to 49. Now 51. Now another trey for Steph, 52. nowSteph folks and both Its hit. Curry answers with another trey, And now Clippers at the line.<|endoftext|>Easy. Cheeseburger from apple pan<|endoftext|>Hit a 3. Lead by 6. To avoid complete catastrophe.<|endoftext|>Nadal's first serve and Djoko with an unforced error.<|endoftext|>Up Hugh again and Springer watches this one. It's 2-2.<|endoftext|>This is going to be the coolest things ever!!!!!<|endoftext|>Yes, Avard, there are many ways the adaptation could go. It could go the route of "Adaptation", but my Preference is to be more straight-ahead. I was forced to employ the loathed "meta" in order to get the book published. Won't need it here.<|endoftext|>Wilson has the ball batted back and then Wilson catches it and loses big yards. The punt is shanked.<|endoftext|>Hurts, on 3rd and 10 picks ups defensive pass interference and has it to midfield. And follows it with a gimmick play for another 20. And the Eagles putting together a great drive as time expires in the first of 4.<|endoftext|>FOWLER AEGLES THE 13th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Molinari birdies !!!!!!!!!!! Both go to -8.<|endoftext|>Djoko up 30-30 and Federer two from the championship.<|endoftext|>This game has taken 5 minutes and counting.<|endoftext|>Barnes to the plate now.<|endoftext|>COLTS SCORE A TD!!!!!!!!!!!! 7-7<|endoftext|>And Djokovitch goes down. But he's ok. Federer serves 2-4.<|endoftext|>Sale has fallen behind in the count 3-1. And Sale, with two out, gets bullied by the bottom of the order. And in the blink of an eye it goes from 2 out, nobody on to 2 out bases loaded, top of the order.<|endoftext|>Back to Tiger at the par-3 15th and he will have a tough birdie try.<|endoftext|>Sue, I don't really understand what you are saying. Sincerely. What do you mean?<|endoftext|>It is in his head now. 15-30. 15-40. AND DOUBLE BREAK POINT!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Tonight, the best show on TV returns. Bob Odenkirk, Rhea Seehorn, Jonathon Banks and the startlingly good Patrick Fabian continue to create solid gold. An alchemic cast getting better each season. Cannot wait.<|endoftext|>Elizabeth Warren. Finally a person of color. #Yanggang<|endoftext|>Top of the 5th and Hill facing the bottom of the order.l<|endoftext|>Taylor, with the count 2-2 hits a textbook base hit to center. Runner at first, one out and the tying run comes to the plate in the person of Turner.<|endoftext|>The call is illegal formation and illegal block, both against the Giants. It will be first and 20.<|endoftext|>Sale in the 4th now and his pitch count is 68 to begin the inning. Will it get to 100 here? I think it will.<|endoftext|>Pitch is down the middle and Sanatna sends it deep to right and the center fielder playing too shallow has to get back and takes it off the wall but will have chance as ARCIA GETS ALL THE WAY HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Wow. A true academic likes me!<|endoftext|>And now he is up 40-15 with 2 set points.<|endoftext|>its a blip to me too Jon. now when are we getting together. how about I get you dinner over at our old haunt, Houston's?<|endoftext|>Runs for a first.<|endoftext|>HITS THE BATTER!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>What if that apartment had lived on the fifth floor of the sky rather than the 6th. On the fourth floor? Would Busher Shane Jackson had only tossed a man out the window and not a man's life?<|endoftext|>A sack by Chase Young and that's huge as it goes from 2nd and 1 to 3rd and 6.<|endoftext|>Count is 2-2. Brewers lead, 6-4.<|endoftext|>Madsen with a strikeout limits the damage and keeps the Dodgers in the game.<|endoftext|>Certainly: The main duality, the split rivers of life, of which author, story, characters, plot are all tributaries: That Which Is vs. That Which Appears To Be.<|endoftext|>And they will face Rich Hill. Let's look at his numbers. He started Game 4 against the Braves and pitched 4 1/3, giving up 4 hits, 2 runs and allowing 5 walks with only 3 Ks. It took him 83 pitches so he will need a much better outing tonight in a game the Dodgers<|endoftext|>@EdSeaward I love the writing of Alice Munro and consider her work to be the best modern short-storry. her work is, of course, without gender.<|endoftext|>What are your thoughts on the book, Mary?<|endoftext|>Oh, how cute. A white woman pretending she doesn't have have white privilege by attacking anybody in sight to cover her deep racism. So adorable.<|endoftext|>Ensan has been winning with hands on which he has been dominated. And he could have won one just now but Dario makes a big bluff on the river and takers it. Still well behind.<|endoftext|>@neilhimself My mom sent me a box containing all my Sandman comics from the very first to the very last and a bunch are missing. As a kid, I was a comic book nerd who would have them put on hold for me until I had the money, and always buy 3, 1 to read, 2 to collect. Heartbroken.<|endoftext|>A great serve, another great volley and this time it is Rafa who forces Djoko to his south hand and he hits the net. You can see how hard Rafa is playing this one, knowing how much he needs the break and knowing this may be his best chance. 40-40<|endoftext|>Home / Twitter<|endoftext|>Thanks so much, Patrick. The book is very important to me. I do have east coast gigs coming up. Stay tuned.<|endoftext|>Day has just bodied the 7th to fall to -7. Oleson birdies 15, he is -7. Fowler, at 15 has it on the green in two at this par 5.<|endoftext|>At the 13th Cantlay has a 50 footer with a lot of break for eagle and just misses.<|endoftext|>Westwood with another par save, and as he has struggled of late, these saves have been imperative at keeping him in the hunt.<|endoftext|>How about Rahm, he of the skipping stone hole-out, with DeChambeau, he of the even temperament and even evener clubs, and finally the man with the golden albatross, Louis Oosthuizen.<|endoftext|>Beckham with a one handed grab and short of the first down but reaches for sticks and finds them. First down at midfield.<|endoftext|>Mama back in the red zone. quick look at stats. Mama has out rushed Oklahoma 75-34 but that is negligible. It is the dominance in the air where you'll find the difference reflected in the scoreboard. 234-106. and don't forget 3rd down conversions 5-6 vs 0-5.<|endoftext|>False start. 3rd and 14 at the 42. Could be 4 down territory with just under 2 minutes in the opening half.<|endoftext|>A run is good. First down, midfield.<|endoftext|>As we go on the air, a big big swing!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 shots.<|endoftext|>In group 11 is Jason Day and in group 14, is Speech and Poulter. It will be interesting to see who wins that match play. I would take Poulter.<|endoftext|>At the 10th, Dj saves par to stay for a tie for the lead and Fritelli drops a shot and goes to 6 under.<|endoftext|>@GhostPanther @Billyfro @cushbomb @JFrankensteiner @AdamSandler @DavidSpade @LeonPhelps @normhiscock I remember sitting at the table in read-thru dying laughing at the Hi-C and Turkey sketch.

Wow!!!!<|endoftext|>and now the second championship point.<|endoftext|>Miami, down 10-7, end a long drive with a sack and now will attempt a FG to tie.<|endoftext|>An icing leads to a face-off in the Sharks zone. 1:33<|endoftext|>Barnes has not allowed a run in this post-season. He faces Gonzales.<|endoftext|>I have yet to lose a tennis bet this year. I have been following it very close. I have very little doubt about this one but I have enough to keep it from being a 5-star bet: Therefore a 4-star bet on Djoko and a 3-Star bet on Djoko ( U43).<|endoftext|>Goddam if I don't love this, baby doll. Im gonna show Billy Joe this toot sweet!!!!!<|endoftext|>And the guy what owes you the ten bucks, he don't even mention it. And you start to think maybe he forgot all about it.

My handle is therealnormmacdonald. also, how do I get one of them blue checks.<|endoftext|>I would be happy to do it. I love Kevin.<|endoftext|>Flea flicker is sniffed out but Murray scrambles for a first down.<|endoftext|>TD BAMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 21-0!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the only good news is this has happened fast and the Sooners has 46:30 left to catch them.<|endoftext|>Two periods done.<|endoftext|>Verlander facing Benitedi, and it has been a gem so far.<|endoftext|>Sampras was the greatest player of all time. Then Federer showed up. It seemed Federer's career was done 5 years ago. But, no. He has established himself, without question as the GOAT. Nadal may get to 20 but, if he does, it will be due to The French Open. He'll never be GOAT.<|endoftext|>Kinsler a powerful line drive to left field and gardener with a huge jump nut the ball is just beyond his grasp. 2-0.<|endoftext|>The cut is now projected at -1, a nervy number for Bryson who sits directly on top of that number. He's at 16 with a makable putt. Rahm has a long one. And makes a great lag to lead to a tap-in, still tied atop.<|endoftext|>They go for it but ANOTHER PENALTY!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>The review shows the serve is well out.<|endoftext|>There are 2 2-star picks tomorrow in hockey. They are: Bruins (O6) +100 and Senators (O6.5) -130.<|endoftext|>A ball inside finds the zone and evens the count<|endoftext|>So many great ideas discussed tonight, but not one candidate up there offered me $1,000 a month!!! #YangGang<|endoftext|>4 NOW AND UNDER A MINUTE.<|endoftext|>Gregorius is up.<|endoftext|>Since I may never do stand-up again here is some more from my final set, speaking on Tom Hanks Disease (THD), that which very well may be my undoing. Enjoy Part 2.<|endoftext|>What should I say when Tiger wins the Masters?<|endoftext|>The "have a nice day" is meant to be an ironic dig, but, of course, comes off as superior nonsense and borders on cruel.<|endoftext|>Next week, the playoffs begin. The biggest change is that only one player from each conference get a bye this year. I took KC pre-season. only pays +410 (Last year I cashed in for +600). KC only needs 3 wins but the competition will be incredible.<|endoftext|>@PikesvilleAL @comicgeniustoo shoulda come say hi, Al.<|endoftext|>Nadal q brilliantly played point. Great serve, then goes cross-court, then down the line, and finally a drop shot that finishes it.<|endoftext|>14 in 2 minutes. Need a drought and need one fast.<|endoftext|>Kevin, that's very sweet of you to say. But who the fuck is "Old Norm"?<|endoftext|>Shoved with 44. Called by AJc. 4 in the door.

I saw the life pour out the boy, like milk.<|endoftext|>Still waiting word. Send Ted Sarandos a letter.<|endoftext|>Djoko Poule is serving down 2-1 in the 3rd and facing break point.<|endoftext|>Really tough, Andy, since I am so invested (not in money) in Tiger winning this. If I were to bet I would probably bet Stenson and Oostie, because of the very long odds. But I believe that Tiger Woods will win the 2019 Masters.<|endoftext|>I didn't stop Old Joe, I didn't stop Billy, what was my own kin, and I didn't stop the stranger who started the trouble in the first place. I just stood and watched, and watching sumpin is just the same as doin. Maybe God'll forgive me, I just don't know.<|endoftext|>My apologies for my absence.

That's very kind, and coming from a master of the form.<|endoftext|>Porcello continues on his quest for a perfect game. Stanton would love to break that up.<|endoftext|>The total will decide it @cgdx3 has 56, La Seahawks has 55. and I went low with 45. so anything up to 49 I win. @cgdx3 has the accidental price is right bet. Here we go. lets have a scoreless first quarter.<|endoftext|>Here now the face-off.<|endoftext|>And that is Washington's second long long drive. That one took over 6 minutes.

YANG: 2020 VISION #YangGang<|endoftext|>A pause at the 20 to hurdle inside, now.<|endoftext|>Ball hit down the middle and the second baseman Dozier goes to to the right to field it but it is just out of his reach, and Arcia would likely have beat it out anyways.<|endoftext|>down low. 2-1.<|endoftext|>A penalty against the Chiefs followed by a short run. 2nd and 7. 8:20 and counting.<|endoftext|>@BrentPiaskoski Whats going on, Brent?<|endoftext|>JOHNSON AND KOEPKA MISS PAR PUTTS, WEBB MISSES A BIRDIE TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Half was over and the final 6 minutes slowed down dramatically to keep the total alive. Clippers lead 65-54.<|endoftext|>Just slips by and the South African will stay one back.<|endoftext|>The reason the team who gets the ball SECOND team has such a huge advantage @ColinCowherd @TheHerd<|endoftext|>respect, Dave. Fantastic special.<|endoftext|>A and-off and Armstrong runs it to the 13.<|endoftext|>@realjonlovitz hey, Jon. Merry Christmas. Hope you are having a wonderful holiday.<|endoftext|>1-2 to Puig. The fans getting restless, would love to see a K here.<|endoftext|>My average contribution is zero and yet no one takes me seriously. Fucking rich people.<|endoftext|>At 7:11 AM, Charles Howell 3 and Brandt Snedeker will tee off.<|endoftext|>Hit deep to left center and the sacrifice fly gives the Sox a 1-0 lead.<|endoftext|>2nd quarter begins with 11 points in 90 seconds.<|endoftext|>I got Chicago big time.<|endoftext|>And that 51st pitch by Sabathia brings the bullpen to life.<|endoftext|>@jeffradbourne yes, I've been trying to get a hold of Randy Dash. If you know his twitter account, let me know.<|endoftext|>Top of the 8th.<|endoftext|>Fault. and now, as the ball floated in the air for his second serve, a fan yells " Go Rafa" and its double-fault.<|endoftext|>A pass and the runner stumbles but gets seven and Kansas City gets lucky because that looked like a TD. 3rd and 11. HUGE PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>A slow roller to Nunez and he fires it fast to beat out Stanton. that's 4 in a row. 23 left.<|endoftext|>Klobuchar said the vaccine for the corona Virus is in some kid's head in West Virgina. Find this goddam kid. NOW!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Yeah. Hardest thing ever. and for no money. Still, loved it. Working on another now, and a bit afraid this time. Do you ever have that, Adrian?<|endoftext|>Of course, I should have been out of the hand after the check-raise. Would have saved 16K. Clearly he had too 2 pair beat. I played it abysmally and I am shaken. Such a terrible play.<|endoftext|>Indy has just turned the ball back over to Green Bay.<|endoftext|>Incomplete. That is 5 third downs and 5 unconverted. They'll go for a FG.<|endoftext|>BREAKING ALERT: ALL GOLFERS ARE ON THE. COURSE NOW IN AUGUSTA. Patrick Reed AFTER HIS FINE MORNING HAS NOW BIDIES THE SECOND. he is -9<|endoftext|>He pitches one more and that is it. They are going to relief.<|endoftext|>A bad development. The good news is they are still within FG range, 46 yards.<|endoftext|>How did I save your life?<|endoftext|>Thomas will have a longish putt for birdie on the par 5 6th, so it appears he will not be able to double his lead.<|endoftext|>A nine yard run to end the first quarter.<|endoftext|>For those scoring at home, my picks are now 1-2 on 1-star, 5-6 on 2-star, 0-1 on 3-star. 1-1 on 5-star. a total of 7-10 or 70 percent. The magic number to make money: 52.4 percent. If you are betting using the star system ( 1 star =1 unit ) you are up 8.8 units through 10 wagers.<|endoftext|>And I'll tell you why. See, once I was finished dinner, I'd pay the bill, which was between 6 to 8 dollars. And Brucky, she'd always get a dollar. So when I left the restaurant, my net worth was always about the same, about twenty dollars flat.<|endoftext|>Hey, guys, I just got back from the gym. I have no ides who Captain Midnight is but it's not me, that's for sure. as ever, norm Whereas I do not agree with the methods of Captain Midnight in any way, I share his enthusiasm for Candidate Yang.#YangGang<|endoftext|>The clean-up hitter, Gurriel, at the plate now.<|endoftext|>Tiger with a nice chip but it pulls back like a string. It will leave Tiger with a longish birdie try.<|endoftext|>3-star bet Lilliard (O26.5). after the big loss on the Kyrie Over. Kyrie fell short by 1 point.<|endoftext|>MISSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WALKS JUDGE!!!!!!AND THE TYING RUN AMBLES OVER TO THE ON-DECK CIRCLE!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>completely situation-dependent. Have to know the inning, the score, how many creatures on base, who hits next and how many are out. The question has no answer without context. This is why professional jungle umpires are so well-paid, Bert.<|endoftext|>Unfortunately, Knox, jokes cannot be copyrighted. I guess you would have to look at who did it first.<|endoftext|>Thanks, Ray, I think you're right.<|endoftext|>Gates all-im with 6s and @rumnchess has Qs!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>FEDERET NEEDS THIS TO SURVIVE!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Dave, you're a good man and I truly appreciate it.<|endoftext|>THE LAKERS WILL NOT MAKE THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Turn on your television.<|endoftext|>It is very hard to get past Yelich. Th9s pitch way u0p and in and nearly hit him. 3-1.<|endoftext|>This is just awful. Luck loves football. I don't understand this.<|endoftext|>@MillHarvestMess @NoahJMedeiros Fuck concepts, and fuck intelligence and the ability to understand them. Poverty begins and ends with food. The rest is a bunch talking by well-fed people.<|endoftext|>Second is a short one to Barkley.<|endoftext|>30-30and Rafa has never been behind this point. A very important serve. here we go.<|endoftext|>@VincentWaller72 and u wont remember this one either.<|endoftext|>YAYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll tell her.<|endoftext|>But they leave 7 seconds on the clock and now, after the 7 point run by The Spurs, can win with a FG.<|endoftext|>The sad thing is even if you double the minimum wage, it will remain the minimum wage.<|endoftext|>So it would just chug and whir and do what it had to to keep me happy while my body went through the same motions minute after minute after hour after hour. My mind sure could entertain me.<|endoftext|>Smashed to third base and somehow got past is counted as a hit but that was an error, no doubt about it.<|endoftext|>I was too late to play in PAD so I went over to Phil's Room at The Aria to say hi to good friend @phil_hellmuth and tell him my future bets. I met @TomDwan. I almost never get bowled over but I was bowled over. But Tom was a great guy and a very generous spirit.<|endoftext|>Wentz goes deep on the first play and incomplete, but looked like defensive pass interference and to top it off Wentz was roughed.<|endoftext|>all the way to the 25 and now two runs make 5.<|endoftext|>So the big score won it for @cgdx3. He's picked up second place money for the second time as well as making a big win in the suicide league where the 4 remaining players made a deal to take 2K and keep playing for the remaining 6K.<|endoftext|>Can Lowry hang on? His second at 15 is in trouble but Lowry's is worse and there doesn't seem to be anyone else in the field.<|endoftext|>Down goes Mahomes.<|endoftext|>First and goal from the 4.<|endoftext|>No. Remains one ahead.<|endoftext|>Encroachment makes it second 2. Incomplete. 3rd and 2, 3:58 to go.<|endoftext|>And you have to wonder if they'll just roll the dice here and give it to Barkly twice.<|endoftext|>KC used a timeout. Odd.<|endoftext|>Federer is being tested down under in the person of Tsitsipas, who is on point. it is 5-5, without a break and a fantastic clinic being put on by both men.<|endoftext|>Thank you so much, Mary. I'm so happy you're teaching it. I would love to hear anything you or your students have to say about it.<|endoftext|>Steele has just 3-putted and falls to a tie with Westwood, who is a hole ahead and has a knee-knocker to save par. Lee's putter has been a magic wand so far this tourney. This to stay at -5, and, for the first time this tourney. to have a share of the lead.<|endoftext|>BREAKING NEWS: ABRAHAM ANCER HAS JUST BIRDIED 8 TO TAKE THE SOLO LEAD WITH -9 and one hole left.<|endoftext|>Manning does what he has to do and goes deep immediately.<|endoftext|>brown or white?, no wheat back then, brown. white. hash browns? yep. bacon, sausage? Bacon. Anything to drink? Coffee'll be fine. Cash or credit? Goddamit why cant I have the cash. just this once. This one time. I bet I could get on a routine that way. Goddamit. Credit.<|endoftext|>There are 4 bets in the Celtics game. Here they are , 2-star Celtics (-9) (-105), 2-star Celtics O227(-110) Celtics 1st H Boston O 60.5 (-120) and Kyrie (O25) -180<|endoftext|>Federer does what he has to do by holding serve but he must find a point now in at least one of Djoko's serves.<|endoftext|>And they go to the ground, Williams runs it for five. Can Seattle stop Rodgers?<|endoftext|>Neil, I completely agree that you have no right to an opinion when an "emergent truth" states otherwise. But what of opinions when there is no known truth? Are these opinions not folly, as well. Fantastic video, by the way. Great work.<|endoftext|>DJ at the par 3 has just watched Cantlay and Rory ht wonderful wedges and HE BETTER THEM. A very good looking birdie try coming up for Dustin.<|endoftext|>Texas leaguer by Pearce and there are runners at the corners with nobody out for Martinez and you have to wonder how long the Yankees stick with Sabathia. I fear his pitch count is numbered at 50.<|endoftext|>I got to meet and for with Don Rickoes, and I put him in a movie that I hope exposed him to many young people that were not aware of his genius. I met Shelly Berman. I met Robin Williams who was so kind to me and made me laugh with no one in the room but the two of us.<|endoftext|>1-0, then 1-1, then 1-2.<|endoftext|>People always tell me to go there and I would love to, but have know idea how.<|endoftext|>@hollander_don Don, you gotta get some tweets up there, pal!!!!!!!!! And DM me whenever.<|endoftext|>Lakers by 4.<|endoftext|>@AlexanderWatt @PikesvilleAL I agree with Al. That was an incredibly easy answer and they gave it to the most unlikeable contestant ever.<|endoftext|>You see no threat? If you do not like a world run by men, why would you like a world run by women? What's the difference?<|endoftext|>Congrats, @danjlevy, on a great job hosting SNL. You're a bright young man. You'da made a good cast member. I woulda loved to have you practice your craft in front of me but you went another way, partner. Take care of yourself.<|endoftext|>Back to Finau at 12.<|endoftext|>@Shanemgillis Congrats on getting the big show, Shane. Enjoy every moment of it. Peace.<|endoftext|>Is this the great novelist Walker Percy? I only know him from the brilliant " The Moviegoer"<|endoftext|>A dollar don't mean a thing to a man who owns a boat. Two men splitting a dollar on their goddam boat. I just never understood it. I only know I agreed to it because I had a day of work ahead of me and I was hungry.<|endoftext|>@TheEllenShow I hope you and your family are safe during these worrisome days. Peace.<|endoftext|>History will be your ally.<|endoftext|>Thanks a lot, Moe. Really appreciate it. I owe you one.<|endoftext|>Haha, that should read Taitsipas. Still having trouble with A name everyone will soon know<|endoftext|>Thanks. Long Live Uecker!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@MattWilliames Saw Klaus today. Matt. Fantastic work. In animation, it is the draw that elevates comedy into art, and this is what you have done and should be very proud of.<|endoftext|>CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS!!!!!!!!!! THE YANKEES WILL MAKE THE COMEBACK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT I SAID THE YANKEES WOULD COME BACK AND THAT MEANS THEY WILL COME BACK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I am so happy to hear this.<|endoftext|>Why aren't these politicians honest and tell us what they will really do on Day 1? Phone all their friends and say, Turn on the TV. Turn on the TV!!!!!<|endoftext|>Red Sox open the 4th with an infield hit, but then the next three go quietly. Sox still with the one run lead.<|endoftext|>Thank you, Julie.<|endoftext|>Smallwood is stopped so it is a big stop. Giants wisely stop the clock. They will desperately need a score and will have to somehow do it in the air.<|endoftext|>In the pool I stand in 4th all alone with 90 wins.. there are two players tied for second with 91 wins. And RTrimble, for all his bad picks this week, won the final game and that allowed him to stay in first all alone, and , not only that, to keep a cushion between himself.<|endoftext|>Fleetwood bogies two in a row and Westwood, with all pars, is where he began the day. He is 2 back.<|endoftext|>AND THESE WILL BE THE FIRST TWO BREAK POINTS FOR TSITSIPAS.<|endoftext|>A litmus test for Federal Judges. Yrs, how about no Serial Burglars. Or second=story men?<|endoftext|>It looks like they have not had a pitcher warming up long enough. They may have Ryu take his time and walk the batter to fill up first and give the receiver, and I believe it will be Madsen, a few more pitches to get ready.<|endoftext|>No way, Shaun?<|endoftext|>And now Tiger. There could be a 2 shot swing here.<|endoftext|>Hahaha. I love that you've put the quotation marks in, Mr. President. Because usually when quotation marks surround a phrase, it means what is inside the quotation marks ia not true. Either that or you are quoting someone. But you are quoting yourself. Hahahaha. So funny.<|endoftext|>But now they face another third down, this time with 7 to go, and Notre Dame has kept putting Lawrence into these third down situations.<|endoftext|>Hey, do any of you guys know if it's possible to use cryptocurrency to deposit and to play online poker?<|endoftext|>The best player in the field so far is An, who birdied the first 4.<|endoftext|>So the golf went 2 for 4 today, and is no harm, no foul. A loss of 2 units and a gain of 2 units. The tourney bets are in good shape, though, with Phil ahead of Finau and Kuchar and Sneds ahead of Hadwin. And Sneds with a shot to win the whole thing and Phil with a good shot.<|endoftext|>The pitch sails by the catcher and the runner moves over to 3rd. It is called a wild pitch but that was a passed ball.<|endoftext|>Tv timeout with 12 and a half to the half-way mark.<|endoftext|>Yes, please educate me on how comedy works. I've forgotten.<|endoftext|>Yang is the greatest. A cool thousand a month!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Williams runs it for the first down.<|endoftext|>A pass to the sideline and complete and quickly to Sermon for 4 and Murray scrambles for nothing. another 3rd down, 3rd and 5.<|endoftext|>Eagles lead 7-0.<|endoftext|>@stillline not a false word, Matthew. Never thought of it as beautiful, just a peice of my life, but a hell of a nice thing to say, pal. Appreciate it.<|endoftext|>@DarrenConnell87 @ClintConlin @Glasgow_Live You are both hard men then? Is that what you're telling me?<|endoftext|>Down to 22K. Same loosing player raises preflight. I 3-bet to 4K. He shoved. I folded.<|endoftext|>Hey, I'm. watching. the movie Nixon. In it. Anthony Hopkins says, I became President over. the bodies of 4 people. James Woods says, You mean 2. Nixon says, No. Four. Any of you guys know what this. means?<|endoftext|>DJ gets six-foot short. And a chance for a bogey if he misses the next.<|endoftext|>And in betting terms, Djok had to cover 7.5 and he covered it by 6.5 winning by 14. as far as the Under bet goes it was under 31.5 and, at 22, well under, just shy of ten.<|endoftext|>First down at the 25 and Murray runs for 3.<|endoftext|>The scriptures tell us, " For whosoever hath, to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath," Poor people know this is true.<|endoftext|>it is very early but Tiger so far looks like he did at his prime. In the first two holes he overcame mistakes to score two pars. That's when Tiger was at his best, when his worst score was better than everyone else's. It's the bad holes that make the difference, not the good ones<|endoftext|>The first hole couldn't go better as Varney birdies and Brooks bogies.<|endoftext|>And Sale goes way inside and the pitch count is 55!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Manti is right, Andrew. I said it every week on national television for 3 years in the late 90s, a full 20 years before you claim your buddy popularized it.<|endoftext|>And, of course, another debate ends and not a word about The Wolfman. Oh, well, why do I even hope for it, anymore?<|endoftext|>The Spurs can steal one here now with 11 seconds left.<|endoftext|>At the first hole, Tiger missed the green on his approach but handled a ticklish shot and has it very close for a par. meanwhile JT has a birdie to get to 8 under and Dustin sails along with par after par. He is also -8.<|endoftext|>That brings up Bogaerts.<|endoftext|>@michelleisawolf Hi, Michelle, how are you dong during these times?<|endoftext|>And now the to of the order.<|endoftext|>@BarryKatz Hey, Barry, is this you. I was going to DM you but there are a million imposters. Please DM me and tell me something only I would know. Wanted to talk about what you were discussing on an e-mail to me. But I'd rather deal with you directly.<|endoftext|>another story line is the pre-tourney favorite Bryson DeChambeau and his fight to make the cut. He has a birdie try. MAKES IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Cameron Smith now has it to -7, reaching the first-round leaders and two behind DJ, and it cannot be overemphasized the psychological boon to the field that that miss by Johnson puts him back in single digits<|endoftext|>As Tiger begins by saving par at the first after his ball found a bunker on the first and he needed a long putt to fall to remain even. Meanwhile Rory ends with a 7 to go along with his opening 8 and he shoots an opening 79.<|endoftext|>DOWN GOES RIVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>FLEETWOOD BIRDIES!!!!!!!!!!!!! He's -7.<|endoftext|>Another unforced error and I believe that is Rafa's 15th.<|endoftext|>Hahahaha. Too funny.<|endoftext|>And that was incredible. They are still reviewing it but it seems clear the runner was out.<|endoftext|>Djoko has already won 2 tie-breaks, Federer none.<|endoftext|>The Vikings, down 7-0 have put a good drive. together but , late , have to suffer a few penalties, but still have. converted a third down to get to the red zone.<|endoftext|>Voit is up.<|endoftext|>Top of the 8th and Kinsler crashes one off the wall and it is filded bare-handed by Kemp who rifles it to second and it looks out, but no!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>6-3 and Djokovitch will serve for the c championship.<|endoftext|>DOUBLE BREAK POINT!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I'll ask my mom.<|endoftext|>The PAT gives the Titans a 3 point lead.<|endoftext|>GROUNDER TO THIRD!!!!!!!!!!! HE JUST BEATS OUT THE RUN!!!!! GAME OVER!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>The WSOP has begun. Have lost every hand and a third of my stack.<|endoftext|>A pass over the middle to Crowther for 15. 2;33 remain in regulation.<|endoftext|>At 14, a fine tee shot by Tiger.<|endoftext|>Manning with a play-action and he scrambles right but throws it to the end zone in the dirt. 3rd and goal now from the 4.<|endoftext|>It's right over the plate BUT SPRINGER LAYS OFF!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And it took all of 83 minutes.<|endoftext|>ITS GOOD. MAIMI TIES THE GAME AT 10 WITH TIME RUNNING OUT IN THE OPENING HALF.<|endoftext|>Rouille wins his second point and Djoko is serving now ahead 4-2.<|endoftext|>HAHAHAHA. Fantastic, Jeremiah, Fantastic. I'm coming to your hometown. I'll set you up with as many comps as you need. DM me.<|endoftext|>The top of the order and Taylor.<|endoftext|>When people look at chipstacks , they often look at raw numbers, which are important in a peripheral way, if I can struggle to explain.<|endoftext|>And, so, one thing becomes official now. Rafa must break Djokovitch or he loses the match and the tourney,<|endoftext|>Tonight is the same bet as a couple of nights ago. 2 star pick on Lightning first period O1.5(-140). If it wins 2 star pick on BlackHawks first period O1.5 (-162). If first bet loses, second bet becomes a 4-star bet as this is what I call a tandem bet.<|endoftext|>And now Brooks.<|endoftext|>Tiger in big, big trouble at the first. It will take all his magic to get out of this fix.<|endoftext|>I aint toking about Fat Joe. Except I am too, in a way.<|endoftext|>@stb5g5 Scott, I was stunned by a line you wrote, sensing in my wee act the influence of Robert Penn Warren. You exhibit a supernatural sensitivity as I read the great man DAILY. My son called your observation impressive. Dare I edit "impressive" to read "thunderstriking". Thanks<|endoftext|>I believe in Climate Change, but I don't like the climate the way it is. I want change!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And another review goes against Notre Dame.<|endoftext|>It is the second night of the great tournament. Those of us with eyes, witnessed the second of two great wins. I believed from the beginning. Destiny shouts.<|endoftext|>A little shaken by the big loss.<|endoftext|>2 straight balls.<|endoftext|>All that's left now is the over/under on when or if Eli can convert a third down as Beckham makes the grab for a first-down first-down.<|endoftext|>Hill gets Aguillar to a full count but then walks him, so the perfect game is broken up, but Rich Hill is still 24 batters away from recording the no-hitter.<|endoftext|>Nunez with a one-out double and the Yankees must not let him cross home plate in this inning.<|endoftext|>Nadal with a brilliant backhand takes the first point. 0-15.<|endoftext|>Guys, I'm going to rock this event. Get in and get money. I'll tweet the entire event in real time!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Just touched down in beautiful San Jose, Costa Rica. I'll be here until the 12th for the Cage Live. How awesome is that!!??!! It's a wild time-based cash game that must be played to be believed. Get on over here. Anybody?<|endoftext|>Bill, just listened to your podcast with Spade. The greatest, isn't he? You mentioned that you couldn't understand why Letterman likes me. Tell me what you don't understand, pallie, and I'd be happy to elucidate. I can't bear to think of you sleepless with astonishment.<|endoftext|>Citizens of America I'm back. It's Captain Midnight. In 14 minutes the debate begins. I have successfully hacked Candidate Yang's timeline.<|endoftext|>But Federer will challenge.<|endoftext|>SEATTLE SCORES A FG, TRAILS 7-3.<|endoftext|>Nadal fights to Deuce.<|endoftext|>Very cool. Book is made for more more than one read.<|endoftext|>It was my mistake. Molinari lost two strokes to 9 and the swing is huge, taking Molinari down one instead of up one. And now Tiger misses the short putt and loses a stroke. Terrible news in the match play.<|endoftext|>We will play the third set two hours after beginning the first.<|endoftext|>The beautiful Vanessa Barfod. Your man is the King he just won me THOUSANDS!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And after you ate our fat pie and warmed your gut with that fine coffee you'd walk out into the street.<|endoftext|>@holyperes That's beautiful. Goncalo.<|endoftext|>And here's the racket, square and simple. breakfast is 4 bucks. That's if you got the cash. Which you never do even though you keep telling yourself that tomorrow you will; So you take the other option. the credit. but here's the bag. if you pay credit, it costs 5 bucks.<|endoftext|>How is it that Young Tom Morris was also a really old man?<|endoftext|>Tua to Tag for A TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!!!!! And Miami leads 7-0.<|endoftext|>A player is hurt.<|endoftext|>Still have 20K<|endoftext|>Oh, I'm sorry, Keith, did the Yankees not come back in the bottom of the ninth? Were we watching the same game?<|endoftext|>Haha. Too late. I thought I was in good shape when I saw 5-3 in the second, Then I checked the boxscore. 0-2 so far but I'll stay on it.<|endoftext|>With one out in the top of the 6th, Pearce crushes a one-out homer to take a 3-2 lead. And that will mean a pitching change.<|endoftext|>So what can we expect tomorrow. The only thing we know for sure is that Smartino will have all his chips in the middle within 5 hands. And I'm being conservative. I would say odds are he is all-in in one of his first two hands. We will see.<|endoftext|>They are a TD away from covering. Another run by Carson only gets two and a big 3rd down.<|endoftext|>This is the band that informed my early comedy. I first saw them at the Commodore, where the wildly charismatic frontman Doug Bennet would force you to dance. Easily the greatest bar band of all time, Doug's independent streak meant the band was doomed in the US. #RIPDOUGBENNETT<|endoftext|>We did good. Let’s play another game. Here’s the URL. Just click the part that’s in blue. And FOLLOW me.<|endoftext|>13 minutes till the break.<|endoftext|>AND RAHM DRAINS ON. HE IS WITHIN A STROKE!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>A win for Tsistsipas and it is 6-5 in his favor and Federer will serve to stay alive in the first set.<|endoftext|>NADAL TAKES THE FIRST POINT!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>13 to go<|endoftext|>Rodgers to Adams to the 25.<|endoftext|>Stupid, Very stupid. No one can beat DJ other than DJ, but the player who blew me away was Cameron Smith.<|endoftext|>Murray with his 4th 3rd down now. Needs two yards for the first conversion of the game.<|endoftext|>Just watched A Mighty Wind, my go-to film for sheer laughter. Incredible performances by Eugene Levy, Harry Shearer, Chris Guest, Catherine Ohara and Fred Willard, whom I still miss deeply. But how could all these hysterical performers be blown away by @MJMcKean? Astonishing.<|endoftext|>It's morally wrong for me to do stand-up and cause strangers to possibly become sick. And now, with this virus, it seems even more wrong. I'm postponing my next two gigs, but am hopeful a vaccine comes that protects us all from Tom Hanks Disease (THD).<|endoftext|>And another shutout game for Djoko. And hard to fathom how Nadal is going to break and he will lose the first set if he cannot figure a way.<|endoftext|>Adam Scott misses a short putt to tie Finau for the lead at -9. He remains one back.<|endoftext|>Pearce fouls to even the count and would love a strikeout here.<|endoftext|>DeChambeau, who a lot of people called as winner has had trouble finding the fairway and he has to make a second from pine straw and it is not good.<|endoftext|>@ryandowney Yes, and another thing that's fascinating about Tolstoy. He was convinced that 100 years from his time on earth, all civilized men would be vegetarians and his age would be looked back on as savage. But not yet.<|endoftext|>DJ is four feet away now to get his first birdie in a long long time. It would get him into a 4=way tie in the clubhouse.<|endoftext|>But Boston is using everything to finish it tonight. And Reddick is out there to pinch-hit and he will be a very tough out in this situation.<|endoftext|>A broken-bat groundout and that will bring the top of the order and it is now or never.<|endoftext|>do you remember Bill Guest?<|endoftext|>Well, a good week in football, 8 wins so far. For the season I am 89-70 and 3rd place in my league. The top guy has 93 and number 2 has 91. I move upwards every week. I will soon be giving picks. All the picks I give will be teams I bet on myself. Stay tuned. Its all free.<|endoftext|>This was @shaundeeb's idea and so much fun. And @TimReillyPoker sensed it immediately. Incredible. What a great and fun sit-n-go this was. And then it was followed with the insane Roulette Spin.<|endoftext|>Federer serving, down 4-3<|endoftext|>A FLAG AND DEFENSIVE HOLDING GIVES GABBERT A FIRST DOWN!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Have to sweat that 2nd half Clippers (-2 ) bet. up by 9 right now. Must win by 3.<|endoftext|>A run for 2 and the Skins will let the warning happen.<|endoftext|>A long long point but Djoko wins it.<|endoftext|>Reed just missing from the fringe over and over again, after a week of sandcastle-building.<|endoftext|>First drive was one minute.<|endoftext|>FINALLY GOT THE BLUE CHECK. Celebrating by going on Instagram live tonight to call the Eagles-Packers game with all you guys!!!! SO FOLLOW ME NOW!!!!<|endoftext|>Fouled back. Crowd is silenced. Full count.<|endoftext|>Breaking ball. Strike one.<|endoftext|>Thank you so much for the kind works, @birbigs, as they find me at the most propitious moment. I have long admired your work as well as your path and hope we meet a day. Comedy is so simple if you don't know what you're doing and so difficult if you do.<|endoftext|>6:44. Trying to get to the 3:00 mark<|endoftext|>We do have bigger fish to fry!!!!!!!!! Halibut fish!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Wilson looking at a third and 3 to begin this drive.<|endoftext|>And Koepka pin-high.<|endoftext|>Up high and Springer watches it for a ball.<|endoftext|>the first quarter ends.<|endoftext|>Tiger has just finished his first hole as lashes of rain striking the great man, and we know this is the kind of weather Tiger has historically had trouble with. He is in the bunker at 2, the second in as many for the local favorite.<|endoftext|>25 ticks left.<|endoftext|>Here is Rahm, a VERY legitimate threat.<|endoftext|>A damn near 80 point quarter!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I remember when I supposed, in my great man mean pride, that He was an imagining of me. As if One so Great could be an imagining of one so small. And then, a blinding flash of reason commanded me to understand that I am nothing but an imagining of Him.<|endoftext|>It is also wise to remember that Sammartino began the day in third place with less than 20 BBs. He started with 23 million.<|endoftext|>I loved the game so much. Made some very costly mistakes.hahaha. So fun.<|endoftext|>You guys want me to call the end of the game on Instagram?<|endoftext|>Rahm at 14 now with a 10 foot birdie putt to propel him on top alone. AND HE MISSES!!!! But Rahm still the favorite to lead after Round 2, because he has the 15th now, a par 5.<|endoftext|>Top of the order and Cain bangs it back to the mound where the ace Dodger receiver takes care of the first man himself.<|endoftext|>Of those whose first round is finishing this morning check out Justin Thomas. He opened with 4 birdies in the first 5 holes and was out in 32. He has just completed the tenth with. another birdie. and sits at -5, having birdied 6 of 10 so far. Ill keep you apprised.<|endoftext|>nd then it is Sammartino is on the direct right of @rumnchess and Ensan on the other side. Clearly Samartino will have to move first and fast. So @rumnchess may be facing an early all=in knowing that Ensan will be waiting behind.<|endoftext|>just finished with the first break at The Venom on @ACR_POKER. Will begin next level with 330K.<|endoftext|>an important serve now.<|endoftext|>Down low. 1-0.<|endoftext|>Having said that, of course Nadal is the favorite to go on and fave Djoko in the finals.<|endoftext|>well, not a bad place to be here as I have Minnesota (-16.5) for the game and -7 for the second half. The Bikes have the ball. They can cover both with a TD and extra point but will lose both if they cannot.<|endoftext|>Hits it deep to left field right on the line. Betts sprints over, then slows, and makes a fantastic catch.<|endoftext|>I'm thankful for the simple things in life, like bread. Although I've never tried it myself, I hear it's quite good.<|endoftext|>The @comedynest was the first club to let me headline, three months after my first amateur night in Ottawa.<|endoftext|>I predicted that this baseball game would go 14 innings. It is in the bottom of the ninth now.<|endoftext|>Wait. The World Health Organiziation. WHO!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>They are reviewing it. A huge call to be made early here.<|endoftext|>I'm sweating Westwood today.<|endoftext|>So a couch or a floor or some times two chairs, goddamit you'd wake up stiff as hell and hungry. So goddam hungry. Boy oh boy.<|endoftext|>Varner from the deep stuff. And he has lost the ball!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I know what you mean Brandon. I wasn't going to do it until I had more success and it is really my sensei's advice, who wants to stay anonymous but maybe you're right. I certainly don't want people to lose and I gain nothing. I just love my followers and see great opportunity.<|endoftext|>slider strike one. chases one in the dirt for strike 2.<|endoftext|>Hahaha. Thank you, Joe. Hope you are enjoying the holy days on that side of the pond. Say hello to your dad for me. Peace, mate.<|endoftext|>Again right over the plate AND SPRINGER LAYS OFF!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Bullet to Kelce at the 10 but it is behind him and incomplete. 3rd down and only 3 minutes into the contest.<|endoftext|>Thanks for the outpouring of support. Let”s free an innocent woman. #freefelicity<|endoftext|>Cain rips it into the right-field corner, and a stand-up double for Cain, runner at second and third and they must now go to the bullpen.<|endoftext|>And now he will face Martinez.<|endoftext|>Martinez a broken-bat infield single. Men on first and second.<|endoftext|>thanks, Cathy. God bless Ye.<|endoftext|>The reason this is such a good bet is that Washington has a great defense and I think they'll cause a turnover or two tonight.<|endoftext|>Now another angle shows us something fascinating. It was a head-first dive and the tag stayed on as the runner's slide continued and his hand momentarily came off the bag.<|endoftext|>A punt to the 38 of Bama.<|endoftext|>The rarest type of Literature is the comic novel, perhaps because it is the most difficult to write. In America, there was Mark Twain. Then there was Charles Portis. And today, he has passed. Go, now, and read him.<|endoftext|>@JimCarrey Jim, the Biden impression is inspired. You inhabit him. So fucking funny.<|endoftext|>@alandempsey88 Cormac McCarthy is a dear dear friend and his compassion and love of family is a beautiful thing to see. Like Billy Joe says, " It's nice to be important but it's important to be nice."<|endoftext|>And Djoko takes it. Rouille's last chance now. He has not managed it yet but he must break Djoko RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Dirty Work is free now if you would care to watch it.<|endoftext|>Kimbrell is not finding the strike zone. 3-0.<|endoftext|>Slowed down, haha. Been on the road too long. Taking some time off so will dive deep into it.<|endoftext|>The review shows the call was right and Tsitsipas fights back to even this point.<|endoftext|>30-0 now and Bautista two points from evening the match.<|endoftext|>@davidjottley Whats going on in March, Dave?<|endoftext|>The Eagles are favored by 2.5 points and I think this is an excellent bet and I will tell you Vegas is really rooting for Philly because the public is very heavily on the side of the Giants. I feel Philly will easily cover. Let's see who's right.<|endoftext|>DeChambeau bombs a tee shot at the second as Tiger slowly goes through his motions on the way to the first tee=box looking to defend. AND HE WILL. I WILL FOLLOW EVERY TIGER SHOT TODAY!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Springer comes to the plate and he can expect this one to be right over the plate. Don't be surprised if Springer jumps on this one.<|endoftext|>So, I've agreed to pay a game of who wants to be a millionaire because I can always decide not to go for the answer. The money will be paid me in bitcoin. It should be interesting. I have given my word I will not use the computer but I can use 3 of my friends.<|endoftext|>ASTROS LEAD 2-0!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Wow. Notrhings easy but it is finally over. Pus pus push<|endoftext|>Tomorrow: Golf: 2-star Phil(-135) vs Reed and 3-star Sneds (-130) vs. Fitzpatrick. In Hockey 3 star: NY Rangers O6(-110)<|endoftext|>Back from the timeout now Lakers up 134-130 with 3 minutes to go.<|endoftext|>Caught at the ten. First down.<|endoftext|>@travismandrews @toddbarry Wasn't that a Warren Zevon line.<|endoftext|>And so the Islanders score two minutes into the game but then both teams remain scoreless and the Blackhawks Over 1.5 for the first period comes up short the hook for a loss.<|endoftext|>I can't find this interview with Richard Spencer by Jake Tapper. Did CNN take it down? did they apologize for running it? I can't find it anywhere.<|endoftext|>Methinks thou doth protest too much.<|endoftext|>Noe action is on @rumnchess and this move by him di not surprise me. Was he afraid of A-A or K-K. Sure, why not. That would certainly be how you play both those holdings. The most likely, though, of course, A-K.<|endoftext|>And afterwards, and after I ate my Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes and side of fries and ketchup on everything, well then I'd sit back like a gentleman and light up an Export A Medium or a DuMaurier and a cup of black coffee and a big piece of cherry pie.<|endoftext|>Why can't Steyer just pay for everyone's campaign?<|endoftext|>decides against it.<|endoftext|>@JohnWing5 John, do you know of any Canadians down here. I know there are none from our time, but maybe some from more recently. Do you know any?<|endoftext|>The flag has been picked up for the pass interference so New York catches a break but still pays 15 yards. And Went and the Eagles starting to look like last year's team here, late in the first half. Went scrambles and runs forward, sliding for a 5 yard gain.<|endoftext|>@mattywatts @Mark_DMcKinney @emilynussbaum "Brain Candy" is fantastically funny. I remember seeing it and thinking, The Kids will be doing movies, like Python, for years. That's the way it shoulda happened,Jack.<|endoftext|>DJ tends his lead with a birdie on 13. I still say Im wins.<|endoftext|>Oh, are you talking about a youtube channel?<|endoftext|>Taylor, the tying run, stands on 3rd and Turner, 0-4 tonight is the tying run and he is fighting off foul balls here. Count is 1-2. This should be it.<|endoftext|>Still 7 minutes left in the opening half and an incredible 90 points already.<|endoftext|>Thanks, pal. I'll keep working on book 2.<|endoftext|>The rail of Sammartino is getting so rowdy even Flamingo, the Godfather himself, pushed to the sidelines by the physical outbursts surrounding him. And thanks for the great dinner at Todd's place, Flamingo.<|endoftext|>He inherits a 1-0 count.<|endoftext|>@Millicentsomer Hi, its Norm. I wanted to ask you a question about SF but my DM doesn't work. Can you DM me. Thanks. Hope everything is going well.<|endoftext|>TIGER SAVES PAR AND IS 34 coming in. He is one back.<|endoftext|>Doesn't look like Washington will have enough time. Here is the punt<|endoftext|>So every one is telling me not to forget and change my clock tonight. Argghhhhh. I give it 6 months.<|endoftext|>9350. Kinds are next , 300 600 100 ante.<|endoftext|>Westwood, at his final hole, the 18th, is -4, in a very crowded leaderboard.<|endoftext|>Could Tiger and Molinari, the two men involved in the thrilling Open, both lose their matches after both leading. We saw a two shot swing at the 18 determine the first match. DJ came to the 18th tee two head and went to the clubhouse even.<|endoftext|>Thank you, Pal. That makes me happy.<|endoftext|>To show you the streak DJ is on. In the last 11 holes, DJ has 4 pars and 7. birdies. ASTONISHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Break before final rebuy just happened. Avg stack is 16. I have just north of 50.<|endoftext|>A hand-off to the 10. Under 11 now.<|endoftext|>PLISKOVA HAS WON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>A handoff and Carson busts for 6.<|endoftext|>Still answering questions over on Instagram with my mother! Here’s one! Check out the rest on my story and follow at<|endoftext|>DEUCE NUMBER 6!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Among the many dominating stats that will not appear in the boxscores but can be seen here live is one incredible one. So far, early in this match Djoko has managed 8 backhand winners111 Rafa has one.<|endoftext|>And then Bam just walked the ball downfield. It was just second and 2 at the 7 and again the Sooners come up with a big second-down in the red-zone stop. It's 3rd and 6 from the 11. Can Oklahoma keep Alabama out of the end zone. We'll find out right now.<|endoftext|>And now already 29 4 minutes in. Still 20 minutes. Have to stay under 110.5. Another sweat for a push<|endoftext|>The punt is nearly blocked but it goes very deep and Washington pinned back at the 15.<|endoftext|>As I just said, Tiger serves notice. He is now one under par!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>DEEP PACE ALL THE WAY TO THE 17!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>get out to support @Stapes.<|endoftext|>If most people have special-needs, Yang, what makes them so goldang special?<|endoftext|>A pop-up and Sale may be able to survive this thing. he would love a one-pitch double play!!!!!!!!!! At the plate is the designated hitter Tyler White. Expect a pitch in the strike zone and expect White to be expecting that as well.<|endoftext|>And my prediction from game one that Mahomes would break the single-season TD record id alive even though no one in the media is talking about it.<|endoftext|>Hey, just saw that @ACR_POKER is bringing back their Freebie Super Series starting October 16th. I haven't played it before but have heard good things. There is 250K in guarantees and buy-in is zero dollars!!!!!!!!! See you there.<|endoftext|>I'm thankful for women, the greatest creatures on earth. Because, without women, there would be no cookies.<|endoftext|>@toddbarry I know that restaurant.<|endoftext|>But the count might creep up now, as he is ready to deliver to Boagarts, his 10th.<|endoftext|>Jamie, I still miss your great hidden camera show. Any chance you resurrect it?<|endoftext|>A throw for 8 and now we will see if they go for the longish field goal or go for it at the 29.<|endoftext|>Second serve and Bautista prevails. it's 5-5.<|endoftext|>Packers are 3rd and 9 at its own 20 and a 57YARD PASS TO ADAMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>BREAKING ALERT: AFTER DJ RIPS A PERFECT DRIVE, IM LOSES IT RIGHT INTO THE WOODS AND IS RESTING ON SOME PINE STRAW. IF HE HAS A CHANCE HE MAY HAVE TO MICHELSON THIS NEXT ONE.<|endoftext|>Timeout. It'll be second and eight.<|endoftext|>first and 10 at the opponents 35.<|endoftext|>Yessir, there was pain every day back then and you had to suffer it. If you didn't, and some poor souls couldn't. then you just give up and not even a funeral for you. Just put your body in a bag, dig a hole and that's the end of you. I seen it. Seen it with my own eyes,<|endoftext|>Half is over. 14-7.<|endoftext|>Good point. Said it every week on national TV decades before Buzzfeed existed. just another example of fake news.<|endoftext|>Reddick steps to the plate.<|endoftext|>Nadal takes the point and he's fighting hard because he knows he can't make mistakes on his serve.<|endoftext|>Jansen way ahead now and the crowd goes silent.<|endoftext|>Braun up to bat with the tying run on first and 2 out.<|endoftext|>3rd and 7 is incomplete.<|endoftext|>And a quick drive downfield capped by Murray's long pass to the one yard line. First and goal.<|endoftext|>@AngelaRaeBoon1 You are sweet. I will be fine. You have given my spirit a boost. From reading your bio, I know you understand.<|endoftext|>Rodgers scrambles and is almost taken down but throws an airmail pass to Tonyan AND HE HAS IT FOR A TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And encroachment. half he distance and first down.<|endoftext|>DJ from 15 feet uphill now for par as his bogey went falling by. IT LOOKS GOOD BUT NO!!!!!!!!!!!!! DJ cards his first bogey of the week with a 3-putt.<|endoftext|>Both overs just came over and the Grand Salami to boot. That is a net profit of 6 units for the day.<|endoftext|>Ah, yes. I remember it well.<|endoftext|>A hand off to Barkley on first down with a minute and he picks up 2. I think that was a big mistake. It kills a half-minute.<|endoftext|>Fouled off, and each of those two-strike fouls must feel like rapiers to Sale. And there is another. Pitch count up to 68.<|endoftext|>AND THSI TIME IT IS RAFA WHO PUTS IT INTO THE NET. AND WHAT PAIN THAT MUST HAVE BEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>my good friend Cormac is the only one. And, of course, Alice Munro, whom I've never met.<|endoftext|>AND THERE HE GOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>thank you so much. I'm very proud of the book and am presently working on my second.<|endoftext|>He has about 8 feet. AND DRAINS IT!!!!! NEVER A DOUBT AND BRYSON IS -2 with 2 to go.<|endoftext|>Well, the truth is that the more you know, the more you know you don't know. This is why people like Einstein and Newton were so incredibly humble. This new crew is very different.<|endoftext|>I don't do drugs. I am drugs.<|endoftext|>Christ, Jim, that's a fine thing to say and I'm a little puzzled because all it was was a little remembering but so many people have responded, I gotta tel you, it makes me feel good. Me and my damnable pride. haha<|endoftext|>15-15 now and now 30-15 and now 40 and now game.<|endoftext|>90 seconds go by. Face-off.<|endoftext|>AND BRYSON MISSES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Thomas now for birdie.<|endoftext|>Wouldn't this be something if RaFA could break right back. He may need to to have a chance at the Tourney.<|endoftext|>Right to him.<|endoftext|>FUCK, YES!!!!!!! TELL AXL AND THE BOYS I'M READY TO OPEN FOR THEM!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Cantlay birdies to get to -3 and up ahead Koepka with a birdie try and the line was perfect but 2 inches short. JT now for a birdie.<|endoftext|>First down at midfield. 7n mins left.<|endoftext|>Climate Change knows no color.<|endoftext|>And now Im from 90 yards and a fine angle.<|endoftext|>If he leaves this short he is a huge choker<|endoftext|>For all the bluster of the "experts", it is now Dechambeau who might be. fighting to make the cut tomorrow afternoon.<|endoftext|>Haha. A little premature, but, rest assured I'll be taking you guys along for the entire process, keep you in the loop.<|endoftext|>My mistake. That was not a winner. It gave Tsitsipas the Ad and now Federer make sit Deuce number 4.<|endoftext|>I can tell you, in full truth, everything that happened in that 6th floor apartment. And things that happened right after as well, and there's no one on earth other than me what saw Busher Shane at the apartment and at the bar next door fifteen minutes after.<|endoftext|>Fouled off again.<|endoftext|>Ancer finishes the second round with the clubhouse lead and the outright lead with -9.<|endoftext|>Ok, get ready for some drama, kids. The pitcher is Brasier, the batter Voit.<|endoftext|>And he is struck out.<|endoftext|>Yes, that's right. What wonderful parties, John, with the oddball fringe of showbiz.<|endoftext|>We are in the 4th set and there has been what may be an interesting development. During the break, Tsitsipas asked the line judge for a trainer to look at his legs during the next changeover.<|endoftext|>Struggling along. About 45K ow<|endoftext|>And, finally, it will be very interesting to watch the last player of the game, in group 31. I'm talking about the man who could very well be donning the green jacket on Sunday and yet is overlooked by EVERYONE!!!!!!!! Talking bout BRENDON TODD!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>There is an offensive penalty but it is declined.<|endoftext|>Count is even and now Eovaldi falls behind 2-1.<|endoftext|>Hey guys. Today, everybody in comedy is a genius, especially the terrible ones. But once in a while a truly great one arrives. Please watch @TVsJonDore new show Big Questions Huge Answers, tonight at 11:30 on @ComedyCentral. GO DORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And the quarter started slowly but now everything falls.<|endoftext|>40 minutes left. 6 goals needed to beat me.<|endoftext|>Me too, Garret. Unfortunately I loved them a half-point more than you.<|endoftext|>Dodgers now within one<|endoftext|>Too insane not to RT<|endoftext|>Good start as he strikes out Cain in 5 pitches.<|endoftext|>AND A TD BY DENVER TIES IT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>DeChambeau birdies the second, hets to -2.<|endoftext|>Reed has a short one. maybe 4 feet. MAKES IT AND REED HAS HIS SECOND BIRDIE IN AS MANY HOLES!!!!!!!! HE MAKES IT TO -8!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>count is 0-2 and the Brewers may be down to this pitch.<|endoftext|>Thanks, Wes, honored you're following me. Big fan.<|endoftext|>For those that haven't heard the tale. I'll tell it true and hard. But first a night of terrors. But first a night of lies.<|endoftext|>Penalty over. No shots.<|endoftext|>This will be reviewed and this will be interesting to look at.<|endoftext|>@MrMJCox @meeky1981 What were you attempting, Mark?<|endoftext|>THE ACTION ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Hey, I thought Maeve was short for Mavis. Liar!!!!!!!!! That probably wasn't even your jacket. IT JUST WENT AWRY, GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Vikings. with an incomplete pass, then a run that is stuffed. Third and goal now from the 3.<|endoftext|>And who, from the historically anemic NFC East, will go on to the post-season. Will it be The Washington Football Team or The New York Football Giants?<|endoftext|>Tiger is on and was right at the hole but backspin brought it well back.<|endoftext|>Ensan wants both other players to remain alive and focussed on the next rung, losing focus the ladder. But @rumnchess is in the position he is in because he is playing the best poker by far.<|endoftext|>tomorrow, it begins.<|endoftext|>Astros go quickly and quietly in their half. To the fifth.<|endoftext|>Alex Smith has put together a nice drive and has the ball adits opponents 25, 3rd and 10.<|endoftext|>Rahm now pars the final hole and joins the other clubhouse leaders at -9. Only one player had it to -10 and that was DJ, at the beginning of the second round after 3 straight birdies but he only passed it until the next green, where he backed up.<|endoftext|>Deep to the right field wall. And that is foul by a yard. Wow!!!!!<|endoftext|>She’s doing a Ted Baxter thing when he wins a Teddy.<|endoftext|>I am on record as saying @MJMcKean was the greatest actor on tv and should have won every award. Because of the flashbacks and flash sideways of the program, I remain hopeful he makes another appearance.<|endoftext|>A young comic, @bellykachman got a hundred thousand twitter followers when she bravely attacked Harvey Weinstein at a comedy event the disgraced animal attended. It is a damn shame that females still feel they have to rely on Harvey Weinstein to get ahead in this business.<|endoftext|>Does Federer taste blood.<|endoftext|>Hey, it's me, Norm again. Oh, no, what's with these tweets? And who the hell is Captain Midnight? #YangGang<|endoftext|>Tsitsipas has survived to the tie-break.<|endoftext|>Groundout to 3rd. That is 8 straight outs by the bullpen, now.<|endoftext|>and now it is AD Federer.<|endoftext|>Minnesota has bobbled two punts. they recovered the first but not the second. First down deep in. Minnesota territory for Dallas<|endoftext|>Brewers one out away from taking the first game. Knebel pitching to Peterson.<|endoftext|>Rivers starts from his own 5, with 8 minutes left in the first half.<|endoftext|>STRIKES HIM OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Check out my new Instagram account, with INTHE NEWS.<|endoftext|>Count is 1-2 and Judge with a towering fly ball, but too much tower and it is out number one.<|endoftext|>Top of the 2nd and White is up to face Sale, who had his own troubles in the first but dug himself out of it. When both hitters manage to escape early trouble, you can expect a pitcher's duel. Watch for it.<|endoftext|>What a nightmare for Harold Varner and those of us who are backing him t 2-1. At the first hole Varner birdies and Brooks Bogies and Varner is up 2. Hole 2 and Varner misses a one-foot putt and loses the two back. Next hole Varner loses a ball and is on the green in 5.<|endoftext|>Varner misses badly off the tee and gets on and has a tough par putt. Brooks slides by and accepts par. Can Varner catch him?<|endoftext|>Ball goes up and in on him but does not hit Hicks, but rather the bat. Still 0-2.<|endoftext|>Elliot runs one. Does nothing but kill clock.<|endoftext|>Just checked the scores. it went one for two. the first was theTampa Bay loss so, as a two star bet, it lost 3.6 units. And the second was a Blackhawk win so, as a 4-star bet, it won 4 units for a modest profit of .4 units.<|endoftext|>@MackenskiBC Oh, cool. DM me and I'll send you one.<|endoftext|>Call your congressmen!! #freefelicity<|endoftext|>Warren says Bloomberg told a pregnant women to "kill it". Impossible to kill a fetus. Shame on you, Senator warren.<|endoftext|>AND IT IS ANOTHER TIEBREAKER!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>So each batter has seen one pitch from Verlander, and that brings up Martinez.<|endoftext|>So after the review-saving 2 yard run and Went its getting plenty of protection and, on second and eight takes off and ives headfirst for the first down.<|endoftext|>Johnson threw it directly, inexplicably from his back leg into the breadbasket of a Titan standing in the secondary. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Titsipas falls behind 15-30 and ties it 30-30.<|endoftext|>Wow!!!! The great Ward Carroll endorses the show!!!! Thank you sir. I'm a big fan of your writing.<|endoftext|>Why not? Is a child less vulnerable than an adult?<|endoftext|>My mother and I are doing a Q and A on Instagram! Follow me and ask us anything!<|endoftext|>I remain mulish and have placed a double-point bet on Minnesota in the second half.They must lose by 2 to push, 1 to win.<|endoftext|>Maldonado is up now and Sale is a new man, and in two pitches is 0-2.<|endoftext|>The Pack start the second half, and Rodgers drives it downfield but a penalty stalls the drive and they are forced to punt. Hawks take over, down 4, at its own 10.<|endoftext|>Flop cane 8-5-2 rainbow. Small blind checked I bet 1000, Button folded, small blind called. Turn was a ten. Small blind checked I bet my 2 pair for 2K. Small blind check -raised to 8K. I insta-called. Nothing on river. Small blind bet 10K. Insta-call. He showed pocket tens.<|endoftext|>Double-Fault now. 15-30.<|endoftext|>Now lets look at the Dodger's line-up. Leading off will be Taylor, followed by Justin Turner, then David Freese. the clean-up hitter, Machado is followed by Dozier and Hernandez.<|endoftext|>and now 6-1.<|endoftext|>Not much of an effort and he'll have a knee-knocker left. Meanwhile. Tiger with not much of an effort himself, but will surely salvage par. Meanwhile, De Chamber falls to E<|endoftext|>A completion for 9 and this will be reviewed.<|endoftext|>Although I will say I have had word that something bad has happened to Livingston. I didn't hear much so I'm not sure if this is catastrophic.<|endoftext|>The trainer has just entered the arena and Tsitsipas obviously wants to end this in 4 but right now he has to get through his point and is having no trouble with that, up 40-0.<|endoftext|>Where do you see this new wave? Who is the new stand-up comedian you are referring to, this prophet? I would also like to see this. Who?<|endoftext|>@PaulProvenza Hey, Paul, how is the world treating you? haven't seen you in a while.<|endoftext|>Xander has just made his 3rd birdie in the last 4. He is tied with Tiger as well.<|endoftext|>A good serve and back and forth the baseline game goes. And now Djoko places the drop shot. RAFA chases it down but doesn't have enough to get it over. DJOKO BREAKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>There is a 3-star pick now, and it is my second. Remember the last one was a loser. Our first venture into boxing.

They ignore the camera movement is like a John Ford dolly shot.<|endoftext|>a toss to Baldwin for 14 then for 0 and its 3rd and 1.<|endoftext|>And another long Tsitsipas point as he fights off two more break points, which I believe makes it 12, and stays on serve.<|endoftext|>Play action for no gain, 2nd and 15.<|endoftext|>Here we go. Second and goal now from the 5.

Except I am, too, in a way.<|endoftext|>He was a real life world-shaker all right, and his talent was matched only by his integrity.

But I'm now sure he was talking about earlier when @rumnchess snap-folded his Qs to a 4-bet of Sammartino. People mocked the play. I loved it.<|endoftext|>3, 3 and 3 lef.

I said, why do that when so many are hongry. he looked real sad, he said it aint me, it's the guvment. They make me do that. I can't hardly understand but they pay me for it.<|endoftext|>Tiger is at 13 now, and his plan coming in was to take advantage of the par 5s. He has a good shot off the tee, a little unfortunate to dribble into the second rough, and still will have a long way.<|endoftext|>Sorry. Bad. mistake by me. That was Cantlay and not Rory. Rory has a putt with a big left to right break. HE HITS IT!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Thanks, Austin, you're a good man.<|endoftext|>58 with 4 mins left in the 3rd. This thing is a push.

Or are you just cynical because that's easy?<|endoftext|>IT IS 15-40 AND TWO BREAK POINTS FOR FEDERER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>In wagering, my picks have been 10-16, for 62.5 percent well over the magic number 52.4 percent ( the percentage needed to show a profit). But we all know not all bets are equal, so lets see what happens when we use the star system. Then it becomes 25-38, for 66 percent.<|endoftext|>@stb5g5 I also enjoyed your piece on Coleridge. I've been exposed to him recently in his wide wide life. Thrilled to discover he had contributed so greatly to the Oxford English Dictionary. When it comes to Words, to know them is human, to create them divine.<|endoftext|>Hit the shot and almost a 3. Clippers turn it over.<|endoftext|>Well, perhaps I did not. It is double break point and DOUBLE MATCH POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Tiger eagles the first after sinking a putt that was exactly 24 feat 8 inches. Kobe forever.<|endoftext|>New one ready to go.<|endoftext|>4-2 AND THE TYING RUN AT SECOND BASE WITH ONE OUT!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>So that was huge. Instead of Mama having it in the doorstep of the end zone, they must punt.<|endoftext|>A bad pitch but Gregarious was committed. 1-2.<|endoftext|>Pacific scores and they cut the lead in half, down 2-1.<|endoftext|>Looks like the ball may have hit the ground but Green Bay elects not to challenge.<|endoftext|>They will face Gonzales, who has pitched only 2 innings and given up a hit, a walk, and a run, with only one strikeout. The best you can say about him is that he is well-rested.<|endoftext|>Dan is a fantastic writer, and I can't wait for his book to be published!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Sorry that was, of course, Rory and not Justin. JT is ahead and is hitting his fourth after taking the unplayable. OH NO, HE HAS PUT IT INTO RAE"S CREEK!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>A FG here may help the Seattle bettors as a TD will be needed to take the lead.<|endoftext|>And that was not for ten and Murray on second down stumbles falls, and it is 3rd and 4.<|endoftext|>Movie Review: The Coen Brothers' 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs' Is Six Great Westerns in One<|endoftext|>CALLED STRIKE 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Count is 0-2 to Schoop.<|endoftext|>And we could be witnessing the match of the tourney. So far, for certain.<|endoftext|>Back to Tiger at 13. He has an 8-footer for birdie and a chance to get it under par for the day and -5 for the tourney.<|endoftext|>And Seattle uses a timeout.<|endoftext|>The extra point means the Seahawks are up by the magic 3.<|endoftext|>@realjonlovitz Hey, Jon, just saw you in City Slickers 2. Didn't even know you were in it but you steal the film. Absolutely hysterical. You gotta get back on the big screen, pallie, we miss you.<|endoftext|>Federer takes the second but then a mini-break. Djokovitch serving up 2-1.<|endoftext|>Manning now goes deep to the end zone to Lammiter. And there were some crossed wires there as Lammiter slowed down and had no chance. 3rd down and 10.<|endoftext|>HITS IT DEEP DEEP DEEP but found way back in that indentation.<|endoftext|>I was wrong about that, Keith, but right about the BIG PREDICTION.<|endoftext|>The ball way up to NY's 42 now with 17 ticks to go.<|endoftext|>A guy puts the elbow on you for a loan, say he needs ten bucks. you don't want to but he keeps after you, and finally you lend the guy the ten-spot. Now you don't hear a damn thing about it. And time goes by and then more time goes by.<|endoftext|>Nadal behind 15-40. Double championship.<|endoftext|>DJ. at the tee on 11. And he hits it left and it does not come back. His second shot will be off the pine straw. Meanwhile up at the green, JT has a very makable birdie try. AND MISSES. So it appeared he would make up for his opening birdie but now.<|endoftext|>Some news for you guys. Tiger Woods will win The 2019 Masters!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Up high again but this time Springer chases it and fouls it off. Still 2-1.<|endoftext|>Complete to the 25. And this brings up a big 3rd and 12.<|endoftext|>Schaufele in a little trouble, having to skirt it under a tree and it finds a bunker. He is a co-leader, Finau just missed another 10-footer. What action!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Knebel walks him and Peterson watches the payoff pitch and he is standing at first. There is a conference at the mound. Knebel is the 7th pitcher for The Brewers tonight.<|endoftext|>Andrew, you are who we need. The year is 2020, and your vision is perfect!!!!!<|endoftext|>If the piece of cherry pie was too slim, I'd hold it up and look at it from different angles, and I''d say, " C'mon, Brucky, you can do better than that. I mean, do these look like the hands of a civil servant?" And they didn't either.<|endoftext|>Verlandet sawing through more hitters here, as it is beginning to look like those two runs will be enough to win this thing, and maybe even one is enough.<|endoftext|>Let's look at some of the tee times.<|endoftext|>A bomb and it is called out and Tsitsipas uses a challenge.<|endoftext|>@xanalter oh. Wow!!!!!!!!! That's so cynical!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Under this system, if you find that a pick you have already chosen has been endorsed by me just add one star ( one unit ) to this pick. A you go on, you can see how your picks are doing compared to mine. If yours are doing better, ignore mine.<|endoftext|>Thanks for listening. I've never heard my book, or any other, so it is not possible for me to recommend it consumed in that manner. The book folds back on itself many times and sometimes over a hundred pages, so a lot will probably be missed. But I hope you enjoy what is left.<|endoftext|>Oh, no. Never. Although, I have been called Normstradamus, that much is true.<|endoftext|>@DavidSpade David, I think you have a hit show on your hands. So consistently great. Congrats to you and Congrats to Frank.<|endoftext|>I don't know why Kuchar was 50-1 but I jumped on it. He has misses two short putts he'd lead alone.<|endoftext|>Tiger has decided to lay up at 15 and he'll have about 100 remaining.<|endoftext|>And, so, now there are men on first and second for Garcia.<|endoftext|>Fouls 2 more off and then makes a great check swing to even the count,<|endoftext|>WOW!!! He shanks it right, and shadows of Detroit.<|endoftext|>@JenniferTilly @PhilLaak The King and Queen of poker, Phil and Jen. What a great night, kids. We'll do it again, soon.<|endoftext|>Off the screen, to the Giants 40 for a first down BUT NOW MORE<|endoftext|>A screen to Barkley and now it is third and 4. Let's see if Eli finally converts one here.<|endoftext|>14 seconds left.<|endoftext|>Going for it.<|endoftext|>At 13, Casey with an easy birdie, and he makes it, and he is E f9r the day and 2 back at -7.<|endoftext|>An amazing reversal. And A great challenge by Pete Carroll and a first down for the Hawks.<|endoftext|>Oh, absolutely. Probably the favorite, tied with DJ.<|endoftext|>When he caught me I was afraid I'd walked out on my bar tab or something. I apologized to Howie for my terrible set but Howie thought it was good. He told me I never had to do amateur nights again, and I'd only ever done one once, that evening. How kind he was.<|endoftext|>Clemson made the worst turnover, at its own 5, but the call was overturned when a review showed the nose of the football may have touched the chalk on the side of the field. Didn't seem enough evidence to change it but the officials disagreed. Score is 9-3 Clemson. They have ball<|endoftext|>Philly will begin with the ball. Jalen Hertz is your quarterback.<|endoftext|>TSITSIPAS BREAKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WINS THE 3rd SET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>well, the Sooners have done what they had to do which was to open the second half with a drive upheld but they now must score. They are close to the end zone but it is 4th down.<|endoftext|>A big run all the way up to the 35. 7 minutes to go.<|endoftext|>Lays off on a very close one. 1-2.<|endoftext|>At 7:33AM, another marquis group as Kuchar joins Kevin Na and Westwood. Is this the time for Lee to win a major? it will rely on his putting.<|endoftext|>Yes!!!!!!!!!!! The great Chevy Chase. Another PURE COMIC!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And Red Sox Nation watches.<|endoftext|>A WALK!!!!!!!! VERLANDER WITH 2 STRAIGHT STRIKES AND 4 STRAIGHT BALLS!!!!!!!!! HOUSTON LEADS 2-1!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>So cool, Alan. Thanks so much. Follow beginning Sunday to see real-time tweets. Will be very exciting.<|endoftext|>It’s going to be galtender interference. 14 minutes left in regulation.<|endoftext|>Peterson runs a third time and finds the first down marker. First and ten at the 35, 3minutes left.<|endoftext|>6 point lead and Derozan is fouled but the ball does not fall To the line.<|endoftext|>Deep again. And missed.<|endoftext|>And now there is one. A delayed pitching change. Odd.<|endoftext|>Ensan still with a gigantic lead; He has double the three others combined with 327Mill. Gates has fallen from being "destined"to go heads-up for the championship to being the short stack with 35 million, 17 BBs, Sammartino,a great great player with 61 M, 30BBs. My man @rumnchess<|endoftext|>2 pitches outside as Sale falls behind.<|endoftext|>That's very kind, Laura. I'm completely fine, just overworking. I seem to be either always moving or completely inert. I'm not sure which is a more sinful waste of time.<|endoftext|>Thank you, Matt. I will be to The Kingdom soon and for some time.<|endoftext|>@boburnham Bo, I wanted to let you know I think you have the capacity to be a world-class comedian but after seeing EIGTH GRADE, I feel you should abandon stand-up as Woody Allen did and make movies forever. Great work, pal. So proud of you as I feel we are brothers in stand-up.<|endoftext|>TD Green Bay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Rams are up 6-0. And they are threatening to score again, 7 minutes into the game.<|endoftext|>Well, the first is that Nadal is the greatest Australian open ever.<|endoftext|>Compare Samartino's play to @rumnchess. Samartino is desperate. he wants all 5he chips in the middle Bec cause he does not want to play a 10-10 after the flop and he'd like to be heads-up so he makes a 4-bet.<|endoftext|>I hope many read his work.<|endoftext|>Completely dependent on the day itself. It is why in restaurants they have a catch of the day. Also, before we reach this state, Colin, we should all have food stockpiled. I, myself, have over 5000 freeze-dried rats and squirrels in my basement. And there's only enough for me.<|endoftext|>Itnalso means Rahm is the only leader playing, so could end the second round with the solo lead and the only player at double-digits under.<|endoftext|>He is 3-5 in this series with a double and a triple.<|endoftext|>@PTSmith_Vt @goodpunt @Talonbooks I have many copies of all his works. May make some available. Perhaps I will open my library. If I love a book, I'll purchase a lot and then when people come over, I'll give them one.<|endoftext|>Sales with another slider and fools Correa. Two down.<|endoftext|>I don'[t know. John. It has been my experience that weather has very very little to do with the outcome of a major. The only one I can recall is when Vijay got the lucky draw and prevailed at the 2000 Masters.<|endoftext|>So the game had a lot of negatives for me. The giant score means I'm so far out of tiebreakers its crazy. Also, instead of being 2 behind Trimble, I'm 4, tied in 3rd. Rtrimble survived his disastrous week, even though those close made a huge run. He still leads by 2 with 94 wins<|endoftext|>That brings up the left-hander Ferguson to face Moustakas and it is a full count. Here comes the payoff pitch. And Moustakas has a 10 game pos-season hitting streak on the line.<|endoftext|>what's with Betty Boop?<|endoftext|>My second 2-star selection is good for the win as The Senators and Islanders go dry in the final half-period and stay under 6.<|endoftext|>Miami has the ball at the two yard line with a first and goal. Minnesota and Green Bay have yet to begin.<|endoftext|>I've lost the second place for the week, but if KC prevails, I take 10 wins to the season leader's 5 wins. RTrimble will still lead but I will be very close. I get closer every week. My totals are the worst in the league so I need to win outright.<|endoftext|>Gregorius with a line drive to center field and finds the gap which allows him to get to second with an unnecessary head-first dive.<|endoftext|>Federer calls for a review.<|endoftext|>Cedeno is the pitcher, in to face Pederson. Watches a strike.<|endoftext|>At18, now, Bryson going over his numbers.<|endoftext|>Rahm saves another par.<|endoftext|>TSITSIPAS ACES TO GO 3-0!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>He misses another and settles for another tap-in.<|endoftext|>Any single player winning is doubtful. The only one saying Tiger would win absolutely was me. Same as last<|endoftext|>So drama from the beginning.<|endoftext|>a man is a coin, no obverse without reverse. If you like, remember Jeff Epstein as monster, destroying lives with a wicked nonchalance. But, for me , I will remember him as the man who killed Jeff Epstein.<|endoftext|>After a big meal, I'd sit alone in the diner and think about all the thoughts I'd thought during the day. That was the great thing about unskilled labour. You didn't need to ever think.

He plays the first two solidly but settles for par. Fleetwood looked like he was in trouble on the first after missing the fairway badly, but got a good break and converted it to a birdie. He is 6 under.<|endoftext|>They did not say it was confirmed. Tough break for the Sooners. Twice they have lost on reviews. Twice it meant 7 points. Wow!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Seattle takes over at the 31 and Seattle starts this drive with a false start.<|endoftext|>Tiger has to use the entire hole at 11 to save par and remain E for the second round.

Tiger knows the course as well as anybody but Phil, who also a good choice, coming off two senior wins. and being a lefty, an enormous advantage.<|endoftext|>DeChambeau left of the green now for his 3rd at 18. AND HE HITS IT A LITTLE HOT AND IT ROLLS PAST THE HOLE DOWN A SLIGHT BANK AND HE NEEDS TO MAKE THE NEXT NOW.

He has yet to convert. Tsitsipas has none.<|endoftext|>They keep saying, Can a woman win the Presidency. Are these people living in the 1950s.

IS THE TIGER EFFECT REARING???????????????<|endoftext|>Tsitsipas gets in a long volley and Roger shanks it. Break point number 2.<|endoftext|>And a backward K as Devers knew it immediately and a quick trot to the dugout. So Osuna has only one left to get out of this jam. Thats the good news.

And Federer ties it in easy fashion. On the other side Tsitsipas has needed 48 points to win his last 3.<|endoftext|>Wentz. scrambles, then sets. pass up the middle to a wide-open allegro, who gets all the way to the 15.<|endoftext|>and now 7-1<|endoftext|>McIlroy with a birdie try now.

He will have a chance here, then one more.<|endoftext|>Read it a couple of times, Ryan. You need to read it at least twice.<|endoftext|>The incredible thing about this match was that Rafa had played a nearly perfect tournament. He mowed down everything in his way. Then he played Djoko and got crushed,<|endoftext|>As you see, I feel good about Phil and feel this is his best chance to win. therefore I recommend a bet of .4 units on Michelson (+2200) and, also, because the payout is so overvalued another bet of .4 units on Snedeker (=4500), both to win the tournament outright.<|endoftext|>The ancient Romans went to colosseums to watch gladiators fight barbarians, tigers fight bears, and wolves fight giraffes.

Do you have a cool story about him as well?<|endoftext|>And now a completed pass all the way to the 6 to set up a first and goal for Dallas<|endoftext|>And that brings me to what happened that night in Caldwell's Holler and what they did, and what I did too, which was nuthin, but now I know it was sumpin, sumpin real bad.

And you are taking a position against a comedian you admit you are not familiar with. So are you not guilty of being told what to think, without informing yourself?<|endoftext|>What is criminal is that no one at your channel has noticed that Patrick Mahome is on pace to break Peyton Manning's single season TD record. He is .88 of a TD behind Manning's pace. Should be tracked, @NormanChad, don't you think?<|endoftext|>Run it for a first. 5 and change to go.<|endoftext|>Top of my head. Instant regret.<|endoftext|>Very good news for Thomas as that ball is dry. And now he'll have a par chip.<|endoftext|>That brings up Arcia and we wool see if the pitcher is going to come to the plate next It depends of course on whether or not Arcia can make it to a base. He is behind 1-2.<|endoftext|>A long volley and finally Nadal misses and now it is Djoko who celebrates. Was that an answer to Nadal's fist pump. A decision to get the audience on his side?<|endoftext|>And, now, runners on first and 2nd with one out and Machado is up, who is batting 368 vs. Gonzales.<|endoftext|>And the Eagles caught a huge break. It was absolutely the right call. The break was that there was a camera shot to prove it.<|endoftext|>A wonderful shot to give him a chance at birdie. Meanwhile, a hole ahead is Oosthuizen, tied with Tiger and with a longish birdie putt.<|endoftext|>And Green Bay LEADS 21-17!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Tsitsipas goes a little long and is sinking of anther challenge.<|endoftext|>@bird_whistler Of, course, Bird.

Peralta is in a pickle.<|endoftext|>This the easy par 3.<|endoftext|>Now, you gotta remember, I'm not talking about Fat Joe, who sits behind the desk chewing on his stoney and yelling out your name and the job you got that day and to get off your ass and put them playing cards down and get out front where a truck will pick you up.<|endoftext|>And another K.<|endoftext|>So, immediately I made either 15 dollars a week or 30 dollars a week.

Hands I to Smallwood and he pick up 5, third and 2 now.<|endoftext|>2 minute warning and that was terrible luck, but now Rivers could ruin everything here in the last two.<|endoftext|>Titans down by 4 with 7 minutes left.<|endoftext|>First up is Torres, and he watches that big loping 3/4 pitch find the strike zone, then miss it twice. 2-1.<|endoftext|>I've I'm very very proud of them.done two comedy specials that are as good as I can do. I wrote a book that was as good as I could do. Im very very proud of them. Thanks for asking, Jon. And how about you?<|endoftext|>Central up 2-0 very very quickly.<|endoftext|>Tsitsipas serves, up 3-2. And, so, we saw great talent in the first set and now incredible heart in the second. The boxscore of the two sets identical so far, but the sets have been incredibly different.<|endoftext|>Wait, Joe. I thought you were performing!!!!!!!! What's going on. You would crush it!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Betts at the plate.<|endoftext|>If he wins a fortune, I win a small fortune. An incredible final hand as @rumnchess does exactly what was needed.

And Hill again ahead on the batter but he just was ahead by that count when he gave up the base hit.<|endoftext|>Tsitsipas is about to win the match and face Raf in the semis.<|endoftext|>It will be fun to watch Rory as he fights to make the cut line. He is playing with DJ and already has a birdie and has just fired a dart to better DJ's. So this will be an interesting trio to watch. We will see if Rory can stay in the tourney and whether DJ can run away with it.<|endoftext|>The Great Depression was a hell of a thing. A hello a thing.<|endoftext|>Whenever I am in your neck of the woods, let me know and I would be happy to have you come as a guest to my show, Anthony.<|endoftext|>The players from yesterday who did not complete their round are out there early in the morning and there are a lot. One player in particular has made a move. He is the unknown Dylan Fritelli. Lets look at his morning so far.<|endoftext|>Madsen now, in relief, will give the intentional walk to Christian Yeleich. I think that was a big mistake to not give Ryu that task.<|endoftext|>Marnes delivers his 20th of the inning and it is fouled iff.

WOW!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Outside makes it 3-1 and a ball here would bring the tying run to the on-deck circle.<|endoftext|>No. But thank you for the compliment. I wanted to make it very sad and very funny, but never mundane, So it is like life except of the mundane parts. It is not life but life's essence. The next book will now your mind and place firmly in the literary pantheon.<|endoftext|>So Rodgers has been much much better than Wilson so far here tonight, and even though it is very early you get the feeling that the Hawks have to score on this possession.<|endoftext|>Rodgers IS SACKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And make it 40-30.<|endoftext|>First and goal at the one and CAN YOU BELEIVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ANOTHER FALSE START!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>RED SOX LEAD 8-2 NOW!!!!!!!!! TOP OF THE 9TH.<|endoftext|>Alice, honey, trust me. I'm a comedian and I listened to what he said. None of us consider it edgy at all, and Shane does not consider it edgy. It is only you, lady, who find it edgy. Now back to 1862 with you, where you can buy a slave, you racist.<|endoftext|>You have probably noticed I have a 5-star system and never give a pick lower than 2-stars. This is because I assume a lot of players will place wagers I have no opinion on. I take these bets to be 1-star bets.<|endoftext|>I never did bump into John Byner but I'm good friends with Super Dave, and he has the greatest stories, first-hand, of so many heroes of mine.

But here is what I think about it. Its all Jake to me. Cept for one thing<|endoftext|>DeChambeau says." Where's that" after hitting the hybrid. It's not bad, missing the fairway just. However, DeChambeau is in toxic shock.<|endoftext|>Up high, the runner goes. It is a hight throw from the catcher and it looks like he made it BJT HE IS CALLED OUT!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@EnterTheDargan I'm far from reactionary, Justin, old pal. Couldn't think of anything more due than politics. all gossip. All gossip.<|endoftext|>An important strike to divers to make it 1-2.<|endoftext|>THE POINT GOES TO FEDERER!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>We are at he 12th now, and we know anything can happen at this hole. FANTASTIC SHOT!!!!!!!!!! And now Im.<|endoftext|>Trying to get to The 3 minute mark with no score.<|endoftext|>@tackofall99 Great job, my friend. I told you they would rope you into it. You wuz robbed!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Another foul and that will inflate Sabathia's pitch count up to 41 already.<|endoftext|>And Djokovitch only lost one service point of 21.<|endoftext|>Bama opens the game with a huge play for 50 yards to start.<|endoftext|>2-1 and no swing yet.<|endoftext|>Fights one off and a big shot by Tsitsipas to pull even but Federer was standing right there and is going to challenge this one.<|endoftext|>Back to the internet. My buddy Jeremy and me are playin g in the 5 million dollar Venom tourney overt at @ACR_POKER<|endoftext|>We may as well begin with the game all will be watching . At 7:30 EST, the defending champ will address the ball at the first hole.<|endoftext|>Warriors have the ball at the end of the quarter and Livingston lays it in to0 give The Warriors a 4 point lead. It is 83-79, 12 minutes to go.<|endoftext|>Tough hole. I own the record.<|endoftext|>I am so sad to see that Boris Johnson will be gone within a few days, a week at the very latest. I always found him to be so erudite and so funny. I already miss him. BTW, no doctors are saying this so pray for the poor fellow.<|endoftext|>Better Call Saul is incredible.<|endoftext|>These are the end days for Dewey Crow.<|endoftext|>Allegor gets 58 yards. First down at the Giant's 15.<|endoftext|>AtOdds: top 5 picks: week 2<|endoftext|>Im with not much of an effort at all and a knee-knocker left from 3 feet, with a lot of break.<|endoftext|>I agree completely. The best putter wins and Tiger seemed perfect until his very last putt.<|endoftext|>6th floor it was. And a party. party no one attending would ever forget.<|endoftext|>Runner goes but Vasquez fouls it off so Jackie Bradley Junior goes back to first.<|endoftext|>The Dodgers could lay down a bunt here and Puig may not be able to field it.<|endoftext|>You too, Jason. Love you.<|endoftext|>He is up. Djoko 0-30<|endoftext|>@morgan_murphy @DougStanhope If only we'd done this when it was first brought up. The markets crushed me. But I have some cash and would still be very interested. It sounds fantastic. No rules for any owner.<|endoftext|>I don't care how you felt about the old name but the new ticker, The Washington Football Teams the greatest name ever.<|endoftext|>When the Big City Rangers knee-capped @CPOO31 , stealing the Cup from the Habs and giving it to L.A., the infuriation was born. The only thing that can erase it is to see @CPOO31 hoist the faith is strong. Watch this video and know why he is my hero.<|endoftext|>Oh, yes. Tell it all.<|endoftext|>@rockmarooned Why do you think it's doomed, Jesse. The show is crushing.<|endoftext|>DOWN GOES LAWRENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I also am not an educated man, but I do know what the word "fact" means as opposed to truth. I have an OED. An "emergent truth" sounds suspicious but I don't know.<|endoftext|>And, so this brings up another break point for Federer, his 7th. And it is certainly his biggest. He hasn't converted one yet, but should he win this one, it will give him the second set.<|endoftext|>Moreland is being replaced at first by Vasquez at first.<|endoftext|>Yang says that immigrants are being used as scapegoats, which h I am against. You know who should be the scapegoats. Goats!!!!!!! Just like the good old days. Sacrifice a fucking goat and leave the immigrants alone.<|endoftext|>From the pine straw, it is out but short of the green. Tiger will need an up and down not to lose a stroke. Meanwhile Schaufelle has an eagle putt for the outright lead. It drifts past and he makes the birdie putt coming back and is a co-leader.<|endoftext|>Walker lays off the breaking ball. 2-1.<|endoftext|>Te Giants now start from the 20. A throw and a run, for nothing, and now Eli is sacked. 4th down. The punt taken at the 30 and run back to midfield.<|endoftext|>One out and now, the go-ahead run is at the plate in the person of Neil Walker.<|endoftext|>STRIKEOUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND THAT TOOK 4 PITCHES!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I'm taking 10% of Jamie. When I 'm heads up with him for the championship you'll wish you'd bought a piece. Take Jamie now. Next to me, the best deal out there!!!!!<|endoftext|>A story true of a man much like my own father but fighting on the other side. Incredible. Incredible. Tell us of your grandpa when you knew him.<|endoftext|>Carrol decides to go for it.<|endoftext|>I was told there would be no math.<|endoftext|>Try to make it back on the late roundball game.<|endoftext|>And this at bat a micro of the inning as Sale got ahead 0-2 and pitched 3 balls to fill the count, just as he retired the first two hitters then filled the bases.<|endoftext|>Faceoff with / seconds left in the penalty. 12 minutes left in regulation.<|endoftext|>Hey, Tom, I am unsure how you feel about postmodernism. I hate it, but I can't tell what your take is?<|endoftext|>I am so glad you mentioned the final chapter. I think it is, in its own way, up there with the best in the book.<|endoftext|>Ball is crushed to third!!!!!!!!!!! Turner falls as he fields it a rifle to first in the dirt and t is dug out. Side retired!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@michaeljknowles that's a scary memory, Michael.<|endoftext|>Rebuy. New table. Call-fold pre-flop<|endoftext|>@JoshNippleton I love the joke<|endoftext|>Yes, but only had 7 BBs.<|endoftext|>And another Clemson TD two minutes later. 23-3 at the half.<|endoftext|>In my very last stand-up appearance I discussed Tom Hanks Disease (THD). Take a look<|endoftext|>A strikeout to begin this one.<|endoftext|>Red Sox by an footstep. And another incredible prediction but he kid.<|endoftext|>@iamcolinquinn But you have to admit the subway can be a little scary with those marauding bands of hedge-fund managers wilding their way through the a-train.<|endoftext|>Kahqaii at the line 10 seconds left. Misses first. Makes second.<|endoftext|>The great Christian Yelich comes to the plate, the most dangerous hitter in baseball.<|endoftext|>BRYSON MISSES THE GREEN. WOW!!!!!!! HE NEEDS AN UP-AND-DOWN NOW TO MAKE THE CUT> HE HAS BROKEN THE HEARTS OF MANY A BETTOR THEWE LAST 3 DAYS.<|endoftext|>@Keyvotes @vijning you never knew me.<|endoftext|>The FG is barely made BUT UT US GOOD 31-10!!!!!!<|endoftext|>DeChambeau at the par 5 15th now and he can feat on this one. But no, he shanks it right. And now Rahm, and it is perfect.<|endoftext|>GREGORIUS GROUNDS INTO RIGHT FEILD!!!!!!!!!!!!! MEN ON FIRST AND SECOND!!!!!! NOBODY OUT!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>AND NO INDICATION YET!!!! BOY DO THE GIANTS NEED THIS TURNOVER!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Got a lot of stuff going on over on Instagram! Caption contests, sports bets, and of course the #freefelicity movement! Don’t forget to follow!!!<|endoftext|>Haha. Thank you, Jon, thank you much.<|endoftext|>Brasier does not look very impressive her. He just misses outside and the count is even.<|endoftext|>A cross-court shot by Djoko and qa courageous shot by Rafa down the line. JUST MISSED> 15-40 Double Break Point.<|endoftext|>Westwood with a big save on the 3rd. He is two back.<|endoftext|>At the second Fowlers approach is close, but Rose answers. Two birdie chances.<|endoftext|>GIANTS STTLE FOR THE FG. 14-6.<|endoftext|>And Federer easily wins the next.<|endoftext|>I haven't thought of that old son of a b-sting in well over twenty years. hope he is well.<|endoftext|>Eagles, now, from its own 42.<|endoftext|>And we have just had our first turnover as Hertz tosses one to Curl and Smith trots back on the field.<|endoftext|>Another emerging story here is the freshman from Vandy, @johnaugenstein who has it up to -6 and is only 3 behind Dustin. ASTONISHING!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I love Iron Mike.<|endoftext|>Can Eli get something going here?<|endoftext|>Putt comes up short. He is out in 33 and is -9.<|endoftext|>When I see that little box beside "sex" on the census form I write, "as often as possible", and me and the census-taker have a big laugh, followed by a few too many swigs of grain alcohol followed by a spirited round of anal intercourse.<|endoftext|>Novak breezes to 3-0. He has won 13m-0ints and lost 1 and it has taken Djoko less than 10 minutes to pull ahead 3-0 in the first.<|endoftext|>Nadal is firs to serve and wins. Djoko answers 1-1.<|endoftext|>@comicgeniustoo Your opinion matters to me as much as anybodies, Avard, and that includes @GordieMcDonald. Thanks.<|endoftext|>A pass underneath for Barkley, and he gets 6 useless yards and Eli and the Giants hearing it from this sold-out crowd.<|endoftext|>Bryson now for the par save at 17.<|endoftext|>7AM, temporary manpower owned and you'd be there at 6:40, you'd figured it all out, that was the perfect time, kept to to yourself, nobody else needs to know, all good friends but competitors too, only so many jobs, only so much that men need of other men. More men than need.<|endoftext|>So, the 3 top players of the world are now tied atop the leaderboard. I've never seen that, meaning it has never happened.<|endoftext|>Let's do it, @Stapes<|endoftext|>POUILLE TAKES THE FIRST POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And he is way past but backs up and will leave him a birdie try from 12 feet or so. and now DJ. They will both have a birdie putt. DJ's may break his opponents backs.<|endoftext|>The first person to give me a job in comedy was Mark Breslin, a brilliant comedy mind decades ahead of his time, that was the anti-club owner, who put a clause in the contract of Sam Kinison that promised him a thousand-dollar bonus to Sam if he walked the room.<|endoftext|>Well, we are living in a thought crime world, Norm. Remember the moment you got SNL, after years and years of hard work. Remember that thrill. Now imagine yourself, 5 hours later, reading a headline about yourself, where you are called a "racist comedian".<|endoftext|>pitch number 4.<|endoftext|>Hill, now with a pop-out and a strike-out and, with a man on first the count is 3-1<|endoftext|>A run for 4.<|endoftext|>Thanks for everyone for your words of support. I am fine. Quite fine.<|endoftext|>@jonjones Haha, Thank you, John. Thank you much.<|endoftext|>I met Jerry Lewis, the incredible Rodney Dangerfeild, the hysterically funny Regis Philbin, although my last meeting with Regis was one of the most humiliating moments of my life. It had nothing at all to do with Regis, who is first-class all the way.<|endoftext|>I am the only one who should interview the greatest, KANYE.<|endoftext|>Broken-bat infield hit to first and a fielder's choice out at second. Another pitching change.<|endoftext|>Jennifer, nobody frightens me at a poker table than you. Just so you know for future interactions.<|endoftext|>Rose birdies and catches Fowler.<|endoftext|>CASEY DRAINS A 15-FOOT BIRDIE AND EXTENDS HIS LEAD AT -7!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I will let you know when it is published.<|endoftext|>And I aint talking about al those little men in the diner downstairs either, those little men with the pencils behind their ears getting all the details down just right so you're special is just exactly how you like it.<|endoftext|>Hey, Jesse, I remember you!!!! Haha. That's my favorite club in the world, @LaughShopYYC. Respect!!!!!!<|endoftext|>AND THE BEST AND THE LONGEST PPINT OF THE MATCH AND THE FACT THAT NADAL WAS GIVING HIS BEST REALLY COULD HAVE STOPPED THIS BLEEDING. BUT NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Sabathia facing Pearce for the second time now.<|endoftext|>@bitusa50 No? They didn't come back? What game were you watching, Moron. Uh, no. HAHAHAHA<|endoftext|>HAHAHA. Wow, a double-levelled joke.<|endoftext|>Miami is. also 3 and out, so all three of my picks do not control the football.<|endoftext|>Lays off the first pitch wisely. 1-0.<|endoftext|>That point took a full ten minutes, certainly not what any one expected after Djoko rushed out to a 40-0 start. But Djoko fought off two more break points. Federer will now have to win to survive.<|endoftext|>ok it seems to be unanimous. haha<|endoftext|>Hertz runs for 4 and a late flag comes in and it'll be a latest against Washington. They cannot afford stupid penalties.<|endoftext|>@JohnWing5 But I wish there were more Canadians of our time to come down here. Wecould all get together. There's Pat Bullard but he's a writer for a sitcom. I mean working stand-ups.<|endoftext|>Final continues to lead.<|endoftext|>And yet another false start and it is 3rd and 9.<|endoftext|>He jumps on the first pitch and another sharply rapped ball, this one to first base. And Sabathia cannot make it to first to cover so Voight has to slide into first to beat the runner. That's two great defensive plays to start his game by the first baseman.<|endoftext|>Run. Time out. And the big double-swing happened on the penalty at the Skins 14 yard line.<|endoftext|>Clippers hit a huge 3. 2 minutes to go. lead by 8. But Warriors Geta shot and the ball.<|endoftext|>Djok won the first set 7-6. Then Federer crushed in the second 6-1. Djoko won another tie-break in the 3rd. Federer won the 4th 6-4. And now it is the 5th. tied 7-7 and Djoko is up a mini-break, serving up 30-0.<|endoftext|>Canadian medicare has some innovative ideas that we could copy here, such as putting old folks on an ice floe and pushing them out to sea. -Captain Midnight<|endoftext|>@MyNameIsGaron @JeffreyWSimpson Thank you, Aaron. I try my best to love everybody and I get the feeling you do, too. peace.<|endoftext|>AND LATTIMER HAULS IT IN AT THE 35!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>A Valentine’s gift for you.<|endoftext|>@andylightning have we reached a point where a show of compassion is considered surprising? God help us.<|endoftext|>The Pack have no timeouts left.<|endoftext|>You're a comic, my brother?<|endoftext|>They was bad times all right, and men did bad bad things, and the chillen with the rickets never had a chance. Still at night, I can close my eyes and see little girl being put in a bag and her mother broke and wailin.<|endoftext|>Meanwhile, Federer is breezing through another point. He is up to 40-15.<|endoftext|>Bautista down 6-5 and 0-15<|endoftext|>complete for the first down.<|endoftext|>Lost a big pot. Down to 300K<|endoftext|>I love it, Billy. I don't like Trump one bit, but you are one godawful writer and please don't make your Savior into a hack writer. What Jesus said was beautiful. " Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me" See how much better that is?<|endoftext|>11-10 and now Federer will ry to survive to the tie-break.<|endoftext|>Tying run at first. And the top of the order for the Brewers.<|endoftext|>Djoko up 30-15.<|endoftext|>And Smith connects for 15 yards and its 5th first down on this impressive drive. First and goal from the 5.<|endoftext|>It is 3rd down now. And a shot downfield.Incomplete.<|endoftext|>First s4rve is good but Nadal lands six inches infant of the baseline and Djoko puts the ball right at Nadal's shoes in no-man's land. Unforced error.<|endoftext|>So after seeing DJ give away the win on his final hole it would be great to see both Molina0r, who has fallen back to a tie with Day, and Tiger with a one stroke lead ahead of Reed.<|endoftext|>This is my good buddy Joe List's great comedy special. And it's free!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I will give my full endorsement to Andrew Yang and do whatever is in my power to help him winz On one condition. That he becomes my close personal friend. The ball id in your court, Andrew.<|endoftext|>Harold Varner pays 2-1 to beat Brooks. My buddy pointed out the good value so I went ahead.<|endoftext|>My God, I seen it all. I seen what man can become. I seen how he can kill livestock and burn it, and pour mill into the gutters, then go to town and see the chillen shakin and white cept around the eyes, grey.<|endoftext|>Brilliant!!!!!!! And I defy anyone to come up with a funnier opening line to a conversation than, " I really got to go." Hahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>The Pack game has just begun. Indy won the coin-flip differed and. Aaron Rogers will bin from the 21.<|endoftext|>Im strikes it AND THAT BALL LOOKS TO BE GOING RIGHT, WHICH WILL BE DEAD. And he gets very lucky and the ball stops dead on the right of the green hole-high. OMG!!!! A BIG MISTAKE may pay off.<|endoftext|>40-15 now 40-30 now.<|endoftext|>Down goes Rivers!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>All you can hope for, if you have any I Teresa in any other player, is for DJ to cool down and have a long run of pars.<|endoftext|>Meanwhile, Matsuyama has a tester at his final hole to stay at -4. And trickles it in.<|endoftext|>It certainly looked well out. i can see now how, should the challenge hold up, the point would be given Djoko. The reason is that the out was called late so Nadal was not influenced by the call.<|endoftext|>We should take suggestions for casting. What a great idea. Get everyone involved!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@morgan_murphy @DougStanhope How much are they asking/?<|endoftext|>what were the questions in tonight's HQ?<|endoftext|>With a 1-1 count, he shows bunt, but manages to pull the bat back and it is 2-1.<|endoftext|>Mayor Pete says we cannot go on with an endless war. Do any of these people understand English?<|endoftext|>Final has chipped it on the devilish 12th, and he will have a knee-knocker to save par.<|endoftext|>Up at 15 and a great shot by Bryson. Lets go to Tiger. A nice shot. He will have a very makable birdie. And now Rahm at 15. And he takes an aggressive lie and may have to pay for it as it bounds through the green. A tough 4th and the idea of a solo lead by end of round is dimming<|endoftext|>WE ARE ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Williams to the 11. First down.<|endoftext|>An interesting side-note. This is the 3rd tie-break in the last 3 sets these two have played, and Federer has won each of the first 2, and, in one of those, Tsitsipas led 4-1. let's see.<|endoftext|>And the wrong time and wrong opponent to attempt a hero call after having it triple-barreled to you. But he hs been on such a cooler for such a long time, I think Sammartino just wanted to make a stand. Didn't work.<|endoftext|>I agree, Ian. The country is being torn apart by extremism. The Netflix doc " The Social Dilemmaq" should be required reading. Peace, my brother.<|endoftext|>9 minutes have gone by in the game and the football has yet to leave Murray's hand.<|endoftext|>lets talk about hog-tying for a moment.<|endoftext|>A completion to Baldwin to the 40 of Green Bay.<|endoftext|>And now, the Brewers in a pickle. You can't really put him on first with a 1-2 count.<|endoftext|>Thats pretty great!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>That longish putt makes up for his missed short putt for par at the 5th and Tiger is where he began the day at 6 under. But he is dropping on the leaderboard.<|endoftext|>The kick looked perfect but was short. I'm not sure an Eagle didn't get a piece of that ball.<|endoftext|>No chance of that, Al. He is not exactly a good force in this world.<|endoftext|>Raonic down a mini-tie break. Hard to know if a win is better.<|endoftext|>10 MINUTES TO GO!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Gonzales with some control problems early on, and falls behind 2-1.<|endoftext|>Back to the 18 and Bryson is setting up to crush this and did we expect anything less than living by the sword with DeChambeau. AND A GREAT DRIVE!!!!!!! HIS BEST OF THE DAY AND WHAT A TIME TO FIND IT IN HIS BAG. HE NEEDS A PAR.<|endoftext|>Went facing 3rd and 6 at his 40 and I know that it is early but any stop the Giants can make seem imperative at this point.<|endoftext|>@MJMcKean @Fred_Willard We should get together a time, Michael. DM me if this idea interests you. I miss you.<|endoftext|>Then he'd say, but like a question, "Breakfast" and you'd say, " Special" and fat Joe would take out five bucks, so now you had a twenty dollar bill, 3 one dollar bills and your thin dime. And, then, you'd go down and say hi to Brucker and eat your fine meal.<|endoftext|>I have been tweeting since pre-season that Patrick Mahomes would break Peyton's passing record of 55 TDs. When will the sports media begin the countdown?<|endoftext|>The other story, of course, is the gallery. Ion one corner, the germans, the other the Italians, it gives it a feel of a soccer match.<|endoftext|>Thank you, Blake. The show is a long term project. Let's hope we get the next several chapters needed. Not a chapter less or a chapter more.<|endoftext|>Trying to keep my emotions in check. Focus.<|endoftext|>And Kelly is now in the bullpen as Sale finds his second strike to even the count.<|endoftext|>And Tsitsipas has to win it with a volley. Scrambles to stay in the set!!!!!!! Well done.<|endoftext|>A thing of wonder to see the great @PhilLaak prove the virtue of patience as he nursed a short stack all tournament and yet, card dead as he was, continue to survive until he got it in with the best finally to finally bust, and see 650 fall before him. Like hay before the scythe.<|endoftext|>White does, indeed, jump on it and drives it foul.<|endoftext|>First serve is good and Djoko puts it back deep and they are playing from the baseline, which is perfect for Rafa's game.<|endoftext|>Kaymer, who is your leader was the co=leader coming into the weekend. He payed 10-1 at that point so anyone taking that bet will be hoping for Kaymer, although would be happier if Tiger could figure a way to prevail. He leads by only 1 over Scott.<|endoftext|>It's interesting, but I believe part of being a champion is the willingness to cheat.<|endoftext|>This incredible tie-breaker has Federer serving at 10-11 and he serves yet another set point.<|endoftext|>I told people what was going on, how the farmers were burning crops, and killing them chicken and hogs and all, but no one would believe me. I seen it seeing with my own eyes.<|endoftext|>Incomplete and a fourth-down decision very early.<|endoftext|>Tears roll fast down my cheek, but must detour when reaching my smile. Kobe did it all, Gianna would have done more. #24and2<|endoftext|>Lady you're barking up the tree, playing the Betty Boop angle to old Pete<|endoftext|>Sorry that Covid has made a Normcast impossible this year but for the of you longtime watchers, you all know @AChadDrew. And he is on the. grounds of Augusta and will be checking in live.<|endoftext|>Here now the opening face-off.<|endoftext|>TIGER 3-putts FROM 20 FEET !!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And some fighting and some loving and some joking and some real serious talk about the way things should be and how the way things are aren't near what they should be and it was pretty serious all right. After all, we all know what happened to Michael Tremblay.<|endoftext|>Hill opens the top of the 3rd with a ground-out and a K, and the no-hitter still alive as the great Christian Yelich ambles toward home plate. Watches the first two and it is 1-1.<|endoftext|>Yes. Thank God it's not just me. But there are fantastic moments, too. After all the hard work, yes?<|endoftext|>But the play was reviewed, overturned and on third down Bama scored. Then Bama's defense went to work and Murray never got the ball out of his hand. This was followed by a 35 yard punt.<|endoftext|>I hear a man talk now in his meanness and he says the times are tough today.The man is on the TV. I tell that man he should thank God for the life he has. Course he can't hear me. Me, I nearly lost mine. My life, I mean. And I seen a lot close to me what lost theirs.<|endoftext|>It's time for the stretch but please remember I predicted this would be extra-innings and it will be.<|endoftext|>Another short run kills some more clock nut TD would be a dagger to the over.<|endoftext|>Over the middle for 8.<|endoftext|>Federer keeps the heat on Tsitsipas here in the 8th game of set 2. There have been no break points but this will be deuce number 3,<|endoftext|>I'm so happy you found the great Billy Joe. I would recommend you begin by watching his episode of Austin City Limits!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>What happens when, on the first hand, Sammartino folds the button, @rumnchess likes his hand enough to re-raise and then is faced with an oversized bet from Ensan in position. He pretty well has to fold all drawing hands and most pairs.<|endoftext|>Gotcha, Sean. Aint that something? I knew an old man and an old woman, married and both in their eighties, and many were the day I'd look from the back window of my dad's powder blue Impala and see them digging post-holes.<|endoftext|>Church, my brother.<|endoftext|>But Donald is first to putt and he BIRDIES THE DIFFICULT 6th AND HE MOVES TO -5!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@MyNameIsGaron @JeffreyWSimpson Hahaha. Sorry, I said Garon and was autocorrected.<|endoftext|>You really can't stop yourself, can you? I'm going to help you, Billy. Whenever you want to use the word "acuity", put "lack of acuity", and you will be correct. I'll send you the first volume of the OED, if you'd like.<|endoftext|>Another time and this time for 3, but the clock is now at 4 minutes.<|endoftext|>Big break for Sales. 2 gone now and nobody out as Sales delivers his 66th to White. Count is 2-2.<|endoftext|>IM now at 10with a 25 footer straight uphill with a substantial left to right break. and he comes up short. Over to DJ<|endoftext|>Your leader, Ancer from the pine straw.<|endoftext|>It was quite a first set. Coming into this match, Nadal had not been broken is 66 straight service games. And that strings broken on his very first serve.<|endoftext|>Swing and a miss. 0-2. And Sanchez has swung on two terrible pitches after a load of terrible pitches.<|endoftext|>A loss of 5. 2nd and goal from the 10.<|endoftext|>My 2 bets were the Clippers who had a huge lead, now ahead by 6, and the quarter finally mercifully ends with a total of 64.<|endoftext|>Cash, 4 bucks. Credit, 5 bucks. Where did that other dollar go.<|endoftext|>The pitch is high and Kemp trots to first and the tying run will amble over to the on-deck circle and Barnes is done. The Sox will use all its artillery right here.<|endoftext|>@michaeljknowles Hahahahahaha. Oh, I see he is you, too. Hahahaha. What a maroon.<|endoftext|>They will have to try the FG. Not much time will be left for Oklahoma.<|endoftext|>Nadal takes the next point. Djokovitch serves. Only one question remqins here. Can RafeaRafaell Nadal break Novak Djokovic<|endoftext|>Day with a very long tough eagle putt will settle for a tap-in birdie and will go under par. Molinaro will lose a stroke.<|endoftext|>a 9 yard run and second and 1 with 65 to go.<|endoftext|>Incomplete start to begin this drive.<|endoftext|>It's the last chance now for Johnson and the Skins. Here we go.<|endoftext|>AND IT SLIDES BY!!!!!!!!!! DECHAMBEAU GIVES UP SOLO LEAD AND TRUNDLES TO THE 18TH TEE.<|endoftext|>And Nada wins his first, and trails 3-1.<|endoftext|>DJOKOVITCH WINS THE SECOND SET!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>We are early int he second set and Tsitsipas is holding strong, the 20 year-old, and has yet proved unbreakable.<|endoftext|>Pitch down the middle for a strike. Its 1-2.<|endoftext|>I support all trans-gender people, but one. That young broke lady who transitioned into an old rich white man.<|endoftext|>Watches a ball and then a stinger down the first base line but it is handles and the 8th is upon us. The Astros and its fans stand in hope.<|endoftext|>The Sooners, after the TD got penalties that had them kicking off from its own 10. But a big mistake by the returner who called for a fair catch at the 20.

Let's take a look.<|endoftext|>Vikes run for nothing. Time out by the Skins.<|endoftext|>And although this will sound counter-intuitive it is a testament to his confidence that @rumnchess is afraid of A-K.

The following are all 1-star bets. I see 1-star bets as having about 1.05-1.00 as an edge so it is fine to simply skip these. They are not nearly half the value of a 2-star bet. I advise them only volume bets attract you.<|endoftext|>Thanks, Al, I appreciate that!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Lead off batter is Judge, here in the Yankees comeback inning.<|endoftext|>An amazing run by Williams for 22 as he ad-libs and changes direction<|endoftext|>The stacks are Ensan with 326Million, Livingston with 120 million, and Sammartino with 70.<|endoftext|>32 pitches, 27 strikes, and the perfect game was stopped earlier.<|endoftext|>Hahaha. I know. I know. How did I know? DeChambeau now in trouble.<|endoftext|>Tonight a two-star pick in hockey. The Over for the first period Blachawks(-1.5).<|endoftext|>Thought both games tonight were at same time. Since they are not, make the first bet s 2-star bet. If you prevail on the first, make the same bet. If you lose tge first bet make the second bet a 4-star bet. There will be time between. Sorry for the confusion.<|endoftext|>Here comes Tiger now and with him as he manages this course.<|endoftext|>Low and away but Voit committed. 0-2.<|endoftext|>Lawrence looking at a 3rd and 4 and Clemson uses its first timeout of the opening half.<|endoftext|>Up high to Stanton. 1-2.<|endoftext|>And it is 3rd and 1 as Alabama threatens to score with 1:21 left in the opening half.<|endoftext|>TD FOR DENVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>3 and out and the ball never got out of Murray's hand.<|endoftext|>I called, nothing on the river and I check-folded an 8K bet.<|endoftext|>A PERFECT PASS BY GABBERT And it falls between the arms of the receiver and that is incomplete.<|endoftext|>the fist made fat the one side that was farthest from the thumb.

Did you think it was funny or not? The correct answer is that it was incredibly funny, of course. Take it from a pro, pallie.<|endoftext|>DOWN GOES MURRAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>This looks great, Mark. I know everything there is to know abut Trudeau and can do a great impression of him. If I can be of any help in any project you may be considering, do not hesitate to reach out.<|endoftext|>I saw Spinal Tap last month, and it is the rarest of things, a comedy film that holds up.

You don't have the common sense that God give a mule.<|endoftext|>Sorry, will not be able to play poker today, as family problems have arisen.<|endoftext|>A six-yard toss to Hetz, and, as he is tackled he laterals it to Jeffries.

Third and 4.<|endoftext|>I can't tweet the live action obviously but I can do it now that I'm out of the Rio and back in the Hotel.<|endoftext|>The Football game was over in the first quarter. In Houston, The Astros are trying to stay alive, bit it appears this ay be the game that sends Boston to the Series.<|endoftext|>First and goal at the 4.<|endoftext|>So, as a bettor it is rare to have the no-sweat victory like that. Congrats to all of you who won and add another 4 units to your bankroll.Sleep well.<|endoftext|>Rahm has a birdie putt to begin his day. RAHM BIRDIES AND JOINS THE LEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I'm not sure why he just did that but my guess is he has been winning so handily on his serves this entire tourney and he has not changed gears from second to three hundred.<|endoftext|>Back to Peterson and he runs for 7.<|endoftext|>We are a nation of immigrants? So, then what's the problem?<|endoftext|>Kimbreo is on in relief. He is 3 outs away from sending his team to THE World Series!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And just like that. a center -QB. change leads to a turnover. Colts take over.<|endoftext|>3rd and 7.<|endoftext|>Did Biden just make fun of a stuttering kid? Or did he just stutter himself?<|endoftext|>Grandal chops it to second. A backhand to 2nd and on to first base. A fantastic double-play and Milwaukee with an incredible performance by Jeffress to get out of that mess!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Atmidfield it is 4th and1 and Philly may as well go for it.<|endoftext|>Ball in the dirt but the catcher keeps it on front of him to save a run. That brings up a 1-1 bases loaded situation.<|endoftext|>I'll be answering questions on Instagram for the next 24 hours! Follow and ask me anything!<|endoftext|>I may put them on sale. I'm just not sure. Might be a hassle. Never sold a piece of merch at a show in my life, but the book is different. Only a limited amount of hardcovers left, so may put them in one place rather than have them scattered around and hard to find. We'll see.<|endoftext|>I hated breaking that 20. Then I had a whole bunch of bills but none of them were worth a damn. Before I broke it it was true I only had one bill, but Goddamit it was a 20. You see what I mean.<|endoftext|>I saw The Green Book today. Both Mahershala Ali and @ViggoArt deserve oscars as doe Peter of @farrellybros deserve for a movie that provides moments poignant and hilarious. Did @ViggoArt base his character on the incredible stand-up, @NickDiPaolo? Have you seen it, Nick?<|endoftext|>He takes a few pitches and they decide to let Gonzales continue, but make no mistake, this is dangerous. That left ankle is the one he pushes off. They should get him out of this game.<|endoftext|>Thank you, Ryan. That's a hell of a thing to say, a hell of a thing.<|endoftext|>IM with a slippery knee-knocker from 4 feet for par. And in the heart. Status quo un touched. DJ ahead of Im by 4 and 2 ahead of Champ, who is a hole ahead.<|endoftext|>Tough Crowd was when I first saw how funny you are, Sue. Coincidentally,, I'm doing a gig with Quinn and I told him this would be the perfect time for a TC reboot.<|endoftext|>Notre Dame has been playing the better game but for one thing. turnovers.. Turnovers. Notre Dame has turned the ball over twice and that has led to all of Clemson's 9 points.<|endoftext|>Denver was within FG range but went for it on 4th and 1. Failed. They now have the ball again with 5 minutes to go in the 3rd.<|endoftext|>The count is 2-0.<|endoftext|>so none of you guys know where I can find the @GaryGulman bit about buffets. I wanted to show it to my buddy.<|endoftext|>And a bad mis-hit by Federer and Tsitsipas is using another challenge here. And I do not believe he thinks this is out. He did not see it. And you can see him talking to himself.<|endoftext|>The best pick so far of the year is Tsitsilanis in the quarters today. @Covers<|endoftext|>Bernie won't take money from the rich but he will take money from the poor. That's great!!!! Wait, what?<|endoftext|>Ball at midfield and Went a quick pass to Clemon at the line of scrimmage and he takes off, and with great blocking, gets all the way to the 20. The Giants defense looks awful.<|endoftext|>But, no. Another shutout point for Djoko and the stats on this first set are simply staggering.<|endoftext|>2nd and goal from the 1.<|endoftext|>That will bring up Nunez.<|endoftext|>AND HE RIPSIT DOWN THE third base-line but it s jsut for<|endoftext|>Another big hand here as Ensan puts in a river bet of 50 million into the pot of 91. Dario has a small pair and Ensan has 2 pair.<|endoftext|>My prediction today: Jordan Speith falls apart big time.<|endoftext|>Gardner to bat now.<|endoftext|>Nearly a wild pitch is Peralta's first attempt. His next is up high. This pitcher has spent most of the year in triple A and the sooner the Brewers can get him out of this game, the better.<|endoftext|>the Cubs bet was a great value. perfect game so far.<|endoftext|>A breaker and Barnes lays off. Ball 4.<|endoftext|>This is absolute insanity. Andrew Yang MUST be allowed into this debate. Take a poll NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Tiger for a twenty foot birdie. JUST MISSES!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Andrew Yang is not in the debate? He is the only candidate addressing problems of the future, such as the increasing vulnerability of our social media. To underscore this point, I plan on hacking Mr. Yang's twitter-feed to live-tweet tonight's debate. Signed, Captain Midnight.<|endoftext|>Tapper back to Sabathai and he goes to first for the out. Runner at second now with 2 out.<|endoftext|>16 minutes to go in the second.<|endoftext|>Hey, James, I was sitting at the next table. I was going to come over and say hi, got involved in a pot, and in that time Mike tagged you, then bated. Sexton rulers, though. DM me, James.<|endoftext|>Stanton is up and he immediately grounds out. No comeback there. We are through 6. Still 4-1.<|endoftext|>Watches it. Low. 2-0.<|endoftext|>Once again, I make my picks on a 4-star system. Last week was 4 bets, two for one star, The Saints(-3) and The Pats ML, and 2 for two stars, the Pats Over and The Pats Over second half. And then yesterday the five-star pick of Tsitsilano ML. Don’t expect many five-stars.<|endoftext|>all my loving<|endoftext|>And a grounder to second for the double-play and Verlander gets out of trouble and a nice 10 pitch inning.<|endoftext|>Djokovitch up 40-0<|endoftext|>I call Sammartino to win and I promise I have no knowledge of what has happened. Its just he has played so patiently. Half-hour left on this level.<|endoftext|>It was 1-0 in favor of the Son and now Devers makes it 4-0 with a deep drive over the left-center section of the wall.<|endoftext|>RODGERS IN TROUBLE BUT SCRAMBLES FOR THE FIRST DOWN!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>It gets cold in Dawson City in the summer in the night. It gets cold n Dawson City every day.<|endoftext|>would you care to get together, John. I'm not sure any other Canadian comics are down here.

Coming to the plate and pinch-hitting will be Santana.<|endoftext|>I have been crushed in the first 3-weeks of my season-long Golf Pool. Every week we pick a golfer.

But, still, hate to see a goal hit the mesh with under 7 seconds left in the opening frame.<|endoftext|>Let's do it.<|endoftext|>Molinari with a wonderful tee shot at the par 3 6th.<|endoftext|>Deep to right center and one out. Correa comes to bat.<|endoftext|>Wentz an incompletion and now a hand-off. THE BALL IS LOOSE!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Hey. Having fun at the WSOP but when I get knocked out before the day ends, I've been playing @ACR_Poker. just stumbled on something called the Cannuli challenge. Thank goodness for online poker or I'd be in the pits at the Rio.<|endoftext|>Altuve watches ball one.<|endoftext|>The pitch is low and away and just catches the zone. Called strike 3.

I look forward to seeing you.<|endoftext|>SMITH FROM A HUNDRED AND THE BALL IS PERFECT BUT NO BACKSPIN, SO HE WILL HAVE A TOUGH SHOT TO PICK UP WHAT LOOKS LIKE A MUST-MAKE BIRDIE.<|endoftext|>Oh, Gosh, that's no good. Nobody told me. How can I help?<|endoftext|>Warriors scrubs are playing an don the line.<|endoftext|>Tolstoy, in everyone's opinion.<|endoftext|>Biden seems to be the Ted Baxter of the group.

Not sure where he is going?<|endoftext|>So another 3 minutes of no scores and I am comfortable with the win.<|endoftext|>Cain will lead it off then the greatest, Christian Yelich, followed bu Ryan Bran. Batting clean-up is Aguilar, then Moustakas, Schoop, and the bottom of the order is Pena, Arcia and the pitcher Gonzales.<|endoftext|>BAUTISTA HAS DONE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>A nice putt does not go in, and JT will wait for Koepka to attempt his 10 foot eagle. AND JUST MISSES. So Koepka moves to -3 and both Fitzy and JT have bogeys and a bogey at 13 is very very bad.<|endoftext|>Down the middle and MUNCY JUMPS ON IT AND jay gets under it for a foul ball. It is 1-2 and Peralta really got away with one that time.<|endoftext|>And that brings the big man up and what a match-up here.<|endoftext|>I'm very thankful for the brave man who pulled me from a burning building last April, and unfortunately perished in the process. I will never forget him. I don't remember his name but I think he had a mustache or something.<|endoftext|>Pederson is at bat and jumps on the pitch. A flare to right will drop and that loads the bases.<|endoftext|>Hey, guys I understand completely. When I finally understood the underpinnings of crypto, it was one of the most edifying moments. It is so deep, please dive in. I studied six months eight hours a day and what a joy. And I hope you get as lucky as I did as a result. Peace.<|endoftext|>Well, wouldn't you know it. Of the 4 afternoon games the loss was the sucker game as Seattle lost. Still, a good day, with the Ravens to go.<|endoftext|>Tiger's first shot bisects the fairway.<|endoftext|>Well, well, friends it seems we are as close as ever before to the one million mark. Only 4000 more. Now I know how Ray Kroc must have felt.<|endoftext|>Good God, man.

Next time, pallie.<|endoftext|>You're a good man, Mark. If you ever want to get together, chew the fat, you just let me know. I got a good feeling about you, Pallie.<|endoftext|>I must speak on the overtime rule as everyone is discussing it, including my old pal @ColinCowherd on his tremendously entertaining at @TheHerd . The rule is remarkably sophisticated. And there is a reason the first TD can not be answered.<|endoftext|>See, that restaurant, I'm sure the owner, he's good pals with the guy what owns the Temporary Manpower office upstairs. They probably take out their boats on weekends and drink champagne and that's perfectly fine.<|endoftext|>It will be Peralta and he does not have the proper amount of warm-up pitches.<|endoftext|>@JoeBerkowitz Thanks, Joe, for taking down that tweet. You're a good man.

Now Koepka.<|endoftext|>Jump on the streak. Two 3-star picks. Warriors 1st half (-4.5) and Warriors(-7).<|endoftext|>First-pitch base hit and the tying run is in the on-deck circe. The Astros second straight two out hits.<|endoftext|>Peralta gets through the inning and if the Brewers go on to win this thing, you can look back at that inning and the wizardry of Peralta being called on without preparation and RETIRING THE SIDE!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Hey, @artiequitter its Norm. I was so happy to see that most recent picture of you, fantastic. Proudayou. Please DM me so we can talk privately. Love you and miss you, my brother.<|endoftext|>Great point, Dennis. I was wrong. I won't do that again. Why grace an idiot with your attention? Very well-put. Life is short and all about choices.

Thanks<|endoftext|>@rumnchess Hey, pallie, sweating you big time. made a huge bet on you when the final table started. As soon as I heard you made final, I said you'd win.

Splinters float like tiny boats upon a lake of blood.<|endoftext|>@epmornsesh Tolstoy, Chekhov, Philip Roth, Salinger, me.<|endoftext|>REED BIRDIES!!!!!!!!!!!! and another 2 shot swing. five minutes ago both Tiger Woods and Molinari were teeing off at a par 5, each with a one-stroke lead over their playing partners. They each leave the hole one behind!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And this is the last thing Nadal wanted to see. He makes a brilliant serve to begin Set 2, mixes it up with a serve and volley and comes up empty.<|endoftext|>Irish to midfield off a nice floating pass.

And I had the honor of sharing an office with Mark at SNL. Comedic genius's both. Brain Candy was sensational.<|endoftext|>Biden is out shaking hands and kissing babies. Sadly, over the weekend, the former Vice President was spotted kissing a hand and shaking a baby.<|endoftext|>I'm tired and I'm slack. I need some sleep the way a baby needs milk. I'll be back here tomorrow and I'll tell you what happened that night on Caldwell's Holler. If I was you I wouldn't read the words I gotta say. Gotta say em to save my soul. but you doesn't have to listen.<|endoftext|>And now Benintendi.<|endoftext|>A BRILLIANT SERVE BY DJOKO!!!!! A BETTER RETURN BY RAFA!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@DarrenConnell87 @ClintConlin @Glasgow_Live You tell me when, Darren. We can talk about my days in the pubs of Dublin where I was the hardest of the hard men.<|endoftext|>And lays off on another very close one. 2-2. What a battle here.<|endoftext|>The longer Ensan can keep the race for second a reality, while he himself gradually chips up, the better and more prudent way to win.And @rumnchess sits in between desperate play and the nonchalant.<|endoftext|>Carson runs for 6.<|endoftext|>People have been asking me if America's Cardroom's 20 days of Free Cash is the real deal. It is. No BS. And that's on top of the 100 % bonus. And, if you use crypto, that bonus grows to 200 %<|endoftext|>Had fun today watching the great one, @phil_hellmuth playing the final table of mega millions on Live At The Bike. Congrats, Phil!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I appreciate that Ryan. Next season is going to be wild. If there is a next season.<|endoftext|>Another break point point missed by Federer.<|endoftext|>And, no. Ryu is out of the game right now.<|endoftext|>People keep flooding my timeline, asking what they can do to ensure the show comes back. Just watch it, and rate it, that's all. And if you want to send a letter to Ted Sarandos over at Netflix, everything helps.<|endoftext|>It's time for Dodgers and the team that will win the World Series this year, The Brewers of Milwaukee.<|endoftext|>A visit to the mound.<|endoftext|>109, 2 mins left.<|endoftext|>Hands it to Barkley but he can only manage one yard.<|endoftext|>A quick live look-in at the baseball game and I see a Brewer standing on second, the go-ahead run.<|endoftext|>They just gave Ellen an award.<|endoftext|>And now an awful punt only gets to midfield and Bama looking to put this thing away early.<|endoftext|>in the dirt. 2-2.<|endoftext|>Yeah, that would make sense, Norm, if Bob Dylan was saying this. The fact is no one thinks this material was edgy. No one except the internet trolls. There was nothing racist in what I have been shown of this man's work. You are a great comic mind, Norm, you know better.<|endoftext|>There is so much to be thankful for when you live in the greatest nation in the best of all possible worlds. I have been in seep rumination today of all the things that demand my thanks. Some will be neglected. But here are some of the things I am thankful for.<|endoftext|>And again. 2-0<|endoftext|>It's always sad when a comedian gets old and isn't funny anymore. Few avoid this. But what if there was a comedian who not only didn't lose it, but instead became funnier everyday, every day until his last. There was one. And now there is not. Bob Einstein is gone. I loved him.<|endoftext|>Im now with a birdie try.<|endoftext|>DeChambeau is buried in the green side bunker at 15.<|endoftext|>Hey, guys, stay safe. Here's Bob Saget on the latest episode of Quarantined.<|endoftext|>Thank you, Reka. I am fascinated by your bio and what it says that you do. What do you do. I'd love to see some of it.<|endoftext|>Judge is leading off against Kimbrell, an incredibly dominant pitcher.<|endoftext|>And they are facing third down and it is beginning to look like a double loss.<|endoftext|>Sammartino has been drawing card-dead for the last hour and it is reflected in the chopsticks.<|endoftext|>Watches the ball curve inside for another opening strike.<|endoftext|>A quick note on Justin Thomas. He remains 2 back after carding 4 straight pars but has a chance to add to his -5 here at the par 5 15th.<|endoftext|>A THREE-PUTT!!!!!!!! Oostie droos to -3.<|endoftext|>A five-footer to get there. GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Green Bay is threatening again and Aaron Rodgers has a ton of time but the secondary of Seattle does not allow the first down. And a 47 yard try now for Mason Crosby.<|endoftext|>856 players started the tourney and 856 remain. That the means the average stick remains 60K. I’m a little under 40K.<|endoftext|>Dodgers go quietly in the bottom of the fifth and in the top of the 6th, Baez delivers to Braun and a first-pitch hit; Man on first and nobody out.<|endoftext|>Here now the payoff pitch to Springer. He walked in the first. He walks here and the Red Sox talk the lead.<|endoftext|>So lets look at the raw numbers. The record belongs to Peton manning with 55. That breaks down to 3.44 TDs per game. If Mahome was on that pace he would have 34.4 TDs through 10 games. But he doesn't. He has 31 TDs. How big a problem is that?<|endoftext|>And he points heavenward in a sentimental nod to his mother, who passed earlier this week.<|endoftext|>The Cowboys will begin with the ball at the 30, and a handoff for 5<|endoftext|>Hicks hits it hard but just got under it and Porcello survives, giving up only 1. But the Yankees are showing they will be fighting this out until the end. I do not believe 4 runs will be enough to win this one.<|endoftext|>A groundout. The Yankees will have to figure out Porcello, because he can easily win when his offense scores thrice.<|endoftext|>6 minutes to survive.<|endoftext|>Federer'am serve. he cannot allow another mimi=break.<|endoftext|>The Democrats' main job here tonight is to pick the candidate who can best Trump. That, and dodging flying spittle during Bernie Sanders' responses. -Captain Midnight #YangGang<|endoftext|>FEDERER BREAKS!!!!!!!!!!! He will serve for the championship<|endoftext|>I love Nick and love whenever I have chance to work with him. Thank you so much for reading the book. I really appreciate it.

Check us out on @pokergo. #pokerafterdark<|endoftext|>Late in the second half, Marriota was slung to the ground and landed on the elbow of his throwing arm. It stung, and the nerve damage knocked him out of the game. Gabbert has been in since.<|endoftext|>BAUTISTA WILL SERVE TO GET THE QUARTERS!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Well, what to do anyway, now as the dimming came. Find a bar, of course. A tavern. A brasserie.<|endoftext|>Another run takes off 5 seconds and uses the Skin's final TO.<|endoftext|>That is a fantastic picture!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Thanks, man. I'm against audio books but I appreciate you listening and for your kind words.<|endoftext|>Count is 1-2.<|endoftext|>One of the truly fine experiences of my life was writing for Max Wright. Max was very rare in that he could play any attitude comedically. Shallow, sweet, cruel, lustful, moved, hateful, cowardly. And on it went. He was a comedy writer's dream: a perfect comedy vessel. Great man.<|endoftext|>Rouille wins his first game but then gets broken and Djoko is up a break and serving 3-1.<|endoftext|>Webb Simpson at the 9, his 18th sits in the green side bunker and needs an up-and down for a 67. And not much of an effort. He'll have 15 feet left.<|endoftext|>They cast their eyes where they always do, to your eyes. And in that moment you see that you are looking into mirror, at an immortal being.<|endoftext|>Way inside but he swings and misses. Strike one.<|endoftext|>I was supposed to see him for the Super Bowl. " We already won, Norm, we don't work at Canadian Tire." We'd play mixed-games till dawn then hop on his bike, 9-ball, ping-pong in his backyard. Goddamit, I miss him.I need a Greyhound. We gotta take care of those kids. Any ideas?<|endoftext|>So many storylines here.<|endoftext|>1-2-3 in the top of the ninth and you know what that means.<|endoftext|>Feels like the toughest week this year for NFL picks. My buddy and I pick 5 a week for the super contest and neither of us have less than 2-3 for the season. Astonishing!!!!!! When will we be shut out. This week we took the same picks for the first time.<|endoftext|>Forget the second wave. What about a second move of the first wave.<|endoftext|>And that took him only 23 minutes so it appears Rafa and Djoko will both be well-rested for the final.<|endoftext|>And Sabathia records his first K.<|endoftext|>They wisely decide to take the FG and they pull to within 18 FG OKLAHOMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>In group 9, is the second pick in my 4-tier pool. the redoubtable Xander Schauffle.<|endoftext|>I have been watching the opening game of the Warriors as they host the bThunder. I felt I could safely watch it since I predicted an extra-inning game in Los Angeles.<|endoftext|>Paul, I watched A Serious Man today and thought how much you would love this film. I'm sure you have seen it.<|endoftext|>It was great to play Caroline's in NYC last week, and see Caroline, Louis, Carolyn, Charley, and the whole gang, as well as Jason and Dom, whom performed with me.<|endoftext|>And another great one, but Gonzales gets a piece of it. Still 1-2.<|endoftext|>DJOKOVITCH BREAKS IN SET NUMBER2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And he does.<|endoftext|>It’s another 10K<|endoftext|>Punt sails through he end zone. And the Giants are behind by 3 premium TDs. They need to score at least 3.<|endoftext|>Bottom of the 8th and the Brewers need something to happen and happen fast.<|endoftext|>Bases are still loaded now for Grandal, with one out.<|endoftext|>Tsitsipas serving for the tie now.<|endoftext|>Sue, I already know what a hilarious comedian you are. what on earth do you mean?<|endoftext|>Wilson is 3 and out again.<|endoftext|>Perez watching the whole way. and it is inside. WALK!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Getting used to Instagram and loving it. I will be answering your questions over there for the next hour or so. Go to and follow me to get your questions answered. See you there.<|endoftext|>It aint dark yet but its getting there.<|endoftext|>Rahm misses a short putt at 7 to drop to -3 with two holes to go.<|endoftext|>3rd down and Russell Wilson misses another wildly. They will have to try a field goal.<|endoftext|>a run to the 1<|endoftext|>A hand off to Carson and he finds a block and picks up first down and more all the way to the 19.<|endoftext|>Pearce back up. He has had a great night.<|endoftext|>Rahm remains tied for the lead. And now his playing partner Bryson.<|endoftext|>Its a beautiful night. I love how funny the internet is. Funniest ever. And it is especially stupid tonight.<|endoftext|>Early excitement at AUGUSTA!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Down to 18600<|endoftext|>The inning began with the Red Sox up by two runs.

Arizona?<|endoftext|>Volley is a long one and now Djoko goes cross-court AND MISSES BADLY. that is one on each line now, or one NOT on each line. 30-30.<|endoftext|>Did Elizabeth Warren just say she was going to tax billionaires two cents!!!!!!! Dirty Commie ( A loser comic would follow this with, that's my two cents!!!! )<|endoftext|>And the Giants are down 14-3 in this game, but if you have him on your fantasy team, it's a good week. That's his second long run, and that one was for 55.<|endoftext|>Rivers was hit as he threw and Gates comes back to catch it but they will have to punt.<|endoftext|>That would be awesome!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>FEDERET WALKS AWAY. NO HANDSHAKE.<|endoftext|>Hand-off and Barkly is swarmed. No gain.<|endoftext|>At the 6th, Louis has a four foot putt to get to -4.<|endoftext|>I cannot endorse gambling, but my choices would be Tiger and Stenson.<|endoftext|>5-4. Tsitsipas will serve to survive the set.<|endoftext|>Happy Valentine’s Day everybody!

IT WILL BE A TRIPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Up ahead, Casey, the second round leader, still only 2 back is paired with Patrick Reed. Both went for the green in 2 last hole. Casey made it, then 3-putted to remain -7. Reed sailed it over the green but made his up-and-down for birdie.<|endoftext|>But, hey, you might say, the guy who owns the restaurant, he has to charge you more on credit. What happens if you stiff him What happens if you keep giving him the runaround saying I'll get it to you, soon, don't you worry. And believe me, I understand.<|endoftext|>That’s so incisive, Bill, but you’d better stay in your lane and write about how Buffy the Vampire Slayer was an underrated gem. You know, your ridiculous job.<|endoftext|>The final shot goes Federer's way after someone from the crowd shouted "OUT" and Federer prevailed 13-1. And a thrilling hour-long enchanter of a set flawed at the very end by a dunce.<|endoftext|>No, they are sticking with their ace for now.<|endoftext|>Djoko up 2-0<|endoftext|>Federer has a history with Tsitsipas, brief yet telling. he previously played him at the Hopman cup, which is played in perth, and which ended 7-6 7-6 in favor of Federer. Neither has broken the other. EVER!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Im is also at -5 and also stands at the teebox of a par 5, the 13th. Will give you the results on these 3 players as they develop.<|endoftext|>Very kind, Adrian, especially from you, but I don't think any book should be "audio".<|endoftext|>This is a long volley here.<|endoftext|>In the first goes the third pitch, 1-2.<|endoftext|>Pouille survives to serve another set point.<|endoftext|>I made a big bet preseason that Mahomes would break the record for most TDs in a single season. If it happens, I will make a fortune.<|endoftext|>Murray's first completion is a beauty to his big tight end for 20. nd now a run for ten.<|endoftext|>another breaker and Bregman is able to lay off.<|endoftext|>SMITH'S SECOND SHOT NOW AND,BECAUSE OF THE BAD BREAK HE CANNOT GO FOR IT AND MUST LAY UP ON A HOLE HE MUST, HE MUST, HE MUST BIRDIE. HE LAYS IT UP AND WILL HAVE A HUNDRED TO THE PIN WITH HIS THIRD SHOT.<|endoftext|>@matthewrlindsey I do not mean great as "very good". I think that is where you are having trouble, Matt. Check your OED.<|endoftext|>But it appears that that call will be upheld.<|endoftext|>I have a two star pick. It is hockey. Under Ottawa Senators (6).<|endoftext|>I used to think Dave Chapelle was the next Pryor. Now I think he’s the next MLK. Very proud to count you as a freind, Dave.<|endoftext|>Fowler misses the eagle, Tiger misses the long putt, Koepka makes a birdie.

He cannot make the first down, but the Eagles are called for roughing the passer, and it could be the biggest play in the year. It was very close.<|endoftext|>Molinari catches a good lie and he is on with a long birdie try. So, Tiger and his opponents are both lying 2 but Tiger is still on the fairway.<|endoftext|>Sorry. Bottom of the 8th. McCannis up for the first time and an opening strike by Eovaldi.<|endoftext|>Felicity Huffman has been sentenced to 14 years in a federal penitentiary for the crime of trying to give her child a decent education.

Button made it 500 and small blind, a strong player called. I called for another 300.<|endoftext|>Im comes out of the bunker and has a tester par try left. And now a very important shot for DJ.<|endoftext|>The tv boys are saying it will be overturned. They were right last time. And Oklahoma really needs this call to be changed.<|endoftext|>Total is 13 second half, and 30 for the game. Big big drive.<|endoftext|>THE LAKERS WILL NOT MAKE THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!! MARK MY WORDS!!!!!<|endoftext|>If you like free money guys, take Tsitsipas tonight at the Australian open. He is listed at 12-1 to win the whole thing. This is an excellent value but I am laying off that one.<|endoftext|>And so for those of you lucky enough to be awake at this hour, you have just witnessed the changing of the guard. Incredible spectacle.<|endoftext|>@MJMcKean Remember when we share an office at SNL, Michael?<|endoftext|>That was odd. Nadal served cross=court, and Djoko returned backhand cross-court, the Nadal same shot, then Djoko same backhand and it appeared as if Nadal gave up on the ball.<|endoftext|>I'm thankful for all of my five children especially the one that I like.<|endoftext|>Tiger is on the green with a par putt. Both Brooks and Molinari have birdie tries.<|endoftext|>Happy Birthday, @DeafFratGuy? Are you having a nice birthday in Maine with Tara and Bennet and William?<|endoftext|>In group 23, the stalwart Adam Scott plays alongside the phenom, Colin" Ballin" Morikawa.<|endoftext|>Finally a scoring drought but it is broken up by two 3 pointers and with a man at the free throw line, with 107 and a 7 point Warrior lead. 2:23 very important seconds left in the opening half.<|endoftext|>You make a valid point. Were you in debate club or something? I'm feel powerless before the the nonchalance of your rhetorical flourish.l<|endoftext|>And now Oklahoma comes out and Bama will want to show its defense.<|endoftext|>Firstly, I'm thankful for the fine ladies who Iive across this country and leave pies upon their windowsills so an old chunk of coal like me might have a meal from time to time.<|endoftext|>So kind!!!!!!!! Writing daily.<|endoftext|>Lawrence to a WIDE OPEN HIGGINS< STANDING IN THE END ZONE AND He drops it.<|endoftext|>Vasquez hits it deep.<|endoftext|>And he faces a third and 9 and this will be pretty huge!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Alabama comes in the biggest favorites in any playoff game ever.<|endoftext|>TD DALLAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DALLAS LEADS MINNESOTA 7-0<|endoftext|>See, this is how it works. After you worked your day you get back and you get your check foe 29 and a dime.

It's tough. Sammartino makes brilliant. call from Gates with Q high!!!!!!!! Exceptional. And you have to feel sorry for one of the greats in the poker industry.<|endoftext|>EAGLES LEAD 31-13!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 6 left in the third.<|endoftext|>Webb Simpson is one of the co-leaders at 17. If he pars in he will be the clubhouse leader at -9. It seems unlikely that will hold.<|endoftext|>Rafa chases it down, and a dropshot of his own. Dijon places it down the line softly but Rafa stabs it with his backhand and it floats over Djoko and lands softly on the big green unattended. 30-40.<|endoftext|>Certainly. Would you like to re-tell us the story for Memorial Day.<|endoftext|>It looks like under 55 and Chiefs (-3.5).<|endoftext|>So many world-class players, so many major champs.<|endoftext|>@GaryGulman I've been watching a great deal of your stand-up over the holiday, Gary, and just wanted to express my great gratitude. Wonderful stuff, all.<|endoftext|>Clippers lead the 2nd half by only 3.<|endoftext|>Seattle has had 4 plays.

I hope we get renewed because I want to make next season ten times better!!!!<|endoftext|>Looking forward to playing the WSOP this summer. I want to practice online but I don't live in a state that has sites. Someone was telling me there were good tournaments at @ACR_POKER.

I can't even imagine how you must feel. The work it takes to get that show and to have it snatched away by some guy who does "Spoken Bird" poetry. Unacceptable.

Too much happening.<|endoftext|>To the goal line and Simonsan. A great pass, but he is hit hard by Darby to save the TD.<|endoftext|>And now Webb holes his final shot, is your clubhouse leader with -5. Matsuyama, your clubhouse runner-up is -4.<|endoftext|>Kemp checks his swing but the ball ricochets off it, foul. 2-1.<|endoftext|>Thank you Jesse. I have grown accustomed to it as well, but am still and will aways remain, an optimist, Peace, my brother.<|endoftext|>@TrippiediJoe He was a mountain of a man, but gently like a fawn, and his eyes never dry after the day the young boy died.<|endoftext|>But DJ can erase that bogey now at 15 with the pa r5.<|endoftext|>TD EAGLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 21-6.<|endoftext|>WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! TIGER IN THE WATER. WHAT A MISTAKE. Hard to see him recovering, and, of course I mean to beat Reed for the day. It will not matter to the tournament. Tiger can still easily win.<|endoftext|>I drank a bit before that night. I never don't drink since.<|endoftext|>Count is 2-1.<|endoftext|>I also said the best values in betting were Stenson and Oostie, and was set to bet on both of them but fell asleep. So I am rooting for one man's success and the other man's failure.<|endoftext|>Tsitsipaswill have first serve.<|endoftext|>What that 6-0 number meant for the bets is that if Djoko wins this in straight sets, both bets are winners. So this is effectively over. Congratulations on an easy win.<|endoftext|>Kemp is up and wants to stop that.<|endoftext|>Up at the green and Rory misreads the putt and. settles for par. Here comes DJ now.<|endoftext|>Linda are 200-400 with a 400 ante and the break is in 90 seconds.<|endoftext|>And a brilliant point as Federer evens up the point.<|endoftext|>Here’s a clip from my Netflix special!

He knows how crucial it is for Seattle to come away from this long drive with a full 7 points.<|endoftext|>And a pitch into the the dirt: Moltanado tries to get in front of it but it ricochets off his chest-guard. Betts goes to second and he is very very fast.<|endoftext|>It's not hard at all. Being a cowardly liar is the easiest thing in the world. And nobody punched down. Don't be so fucking stupid.<|endoftext|>Hey, guys, my good friend and hilarious guy @hollander_don is going to start posting some hilarious content but we have to get him some serious followers.

Will be cool stuff for all of us in the future!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>It is being reviewed. And more sweat now. I beleive this will stand although the boys on the TV seem skeptical.<|endoftext|>Or will the winner come from group 10, where we find the overachieving Patrick Reed playing with the underachieving Tony Finau?<|endoftext|>Swing and a miss. one out. and, now, a double play would end the series.<|endoftext|>Tiger at the 5th and last year he didn't par it a single round and still won. He has to think 4 pars gains him 4 strokes.<|endoftext|>Broken-back single int center right and Muncy, the insurance run, stands on first.<|endoftext|>A run for a yard. and will Seattle score a TD? Still likely but not certain as it was.<|endoftext|>"Take off, eh". Bob and Doug directly before liftoff<|endoftext|>2nd and 10.<|endoftext|>and the easy win by Tsitsipas follows. He is up 6-5 and Federer will serve to stay alive once more.<|endoftext|>Just like that is 2-0.<|endoftext|>A backward toss to Jones who walks it in.<|endoftext|>Haha. Ok, Pallie. Someone not as sharp as me might think there is a " New Norm" you don't think is as funny. Miss you. I'm coming to NYC soon. Let's hang.<|endoftext|>Is this your home town?<|endoftext|>A bigger tent is going to be good for the tent-makers, but who else?<|endoftext|>A break right there would have meant a whole new match. This point is not over yet though.<|endoftext|>@hotdogken why say such a stupid cruel thing?<|endoftext|>Cousin continues on the ground and. falls short. Third and 2.<|endoftext|>Cameron Smith ends his day 5 under through the last 4, and is in the clubhouse tied for the lead with -9.<|endoftext|>A run for 28 but makes no difference.e had to get the TD. No timeouts left.<|endoftext|>Wentz is still out there but I can't believe this is anything but a fake.<|endoftext|>Hit to the shortstop and that will be a ground out. Porcello needed 8 pitches in the first and nine in the second. Boston comes to bat.<|endoftext|>But you get the feel that Tsitsipas has just served, and seven notice, on the tennis world. And watch from here on. Because we have seen his incredible tennis. And now in this set, we will see what his character is. Federer will definitely try to take advantage of his opponent.<|endoftext|>After The Open, I will be playing at @ACR, in the Venom!!! It will be great to play a tourney online after sweating the felt at the WSOP the last five weeks.<|endoftext|>That will bring up the top of the order and Cain.<|endoftext|>Tone deaf? Reactionary? look at the words they have you using wrongly. Check your OED, Justin, old pal. And if you think I'm political in the slightest, you are dead wrong. I find politics like soccer.<|endoftext|>I mean the truth is they coulda charged anything they wanted too anyway. That's how it works, and that's Jake with me, and if you don't like it, you take your business elsewhere. That's how the whole thing works, buddy. the whole damn thing if you wanna know the truth.<|endoftext|>I am currently sweating a very big bet I made at the beginning of the final table. I have @rumnchess at 15-1. everyone told me its was aq sucker best but I could sell it now, I bet. Let's go Canada!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Tiger's ball drifted 4 feet past but he easily converts the par at 16.<|endoftext|>I love bananas. They’re yellow. All I got was a solid gold locomotive.<|endoftext|>@adrianmckinty Yes, It's not good to read one's work except to find the mistakes and not make them the next time. What work of yours should I read first, Adrian?<|endoftext|>A shovel pass to Jones and he breaks and is all the way to the 35 of Seattle.<|endoftext|>Never knew any of those guy's names in the morning. Always guys, too. Brucker and the other gas, they did dinner shift, and cracked gum and cracked jokes and made a fellow less alone when he ate dinner alone. Knew al their names but not any of these guys on the morning shift.<|endoftext|>DJ is paired with Im. First will be Dustin and he has it safely on. His playing partner is Im, who also found the GIR and we will bring you every shot of the top 3, which includes Cameron Smith, one group ahead and 2 back.<|endoftext|>Play actin and an 11 yard pass will set up a FG try. It will be a 47 yard attempt.<|endoftext|>And now another second serve and this one misses. the double-fault makes it 15-30.<|endoftext|>To see those boys starting out, tearing the roof off The Rivoli back in the day, now that really was something, I'm here to tell you.<|endoftext|>It's the Beautiful Sisters.<|endoftext|>A great first serve, a bullet to the corner, but somehow Novak got a racket on it, and knocked back but Rafa takes it down the line and goes to the net, Djoko just clears the net, forcing Nada to go to a half-volley but he was handcuffed.<|endoftext|>That was the Titan's biggest play and a nervous crowd gets some relief.<|endoftext|>Well, Mahome throws his 6th TD and he is exactly ,88 behind the pace of Peyton manning when he made the record of 55. Mahomes has 5 games to pick up 20 to win solo. 4 a game.<|endoftext|>Hey guys Im at my table. Started late.<|endoftext|>Bama a long strike and now a run and now Bama with its third first and goal of the quarter.<|endoftext|>In a New. York minute, One of my favorites was the insane game show!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>IT IS DEUCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>There are 975 players left. The average chip stack is 63K. I have 22K.<|endoftext|>@rthdmc9 Not Swinemeat. Tuesdays.<|endoftext|>And a crack over the head of the third baseman. 3-0.<|endoftext|>And now Djoko wins his set and Federer, after failing on two championship points on his last serve will now serve to survive. Losres the first point to Djoko.<|endoftext|>I seen good too, among the bad. But not enough of it. Not as much as you'd think. Nowadays everybody's got a sompin, even them that got nuthin. But back then, if you had nuthin, you was in trouble, friend.<|endoftext|>AND THERE IS A PICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And a toss for another 9. 6 plays for 60 yards.<|endoftext|>Big big pitch now.<|endoftext|>Tiger is at the first tee.<|endoftext|>Today: 3star:0-1, 2 star 1-3. total 1-4, units won: -7.24. Year to date: 5star:1-1, 3-star 0-2, 2-star: 6-9, 1-star: 1-2. Total 8-14, 57 percent, well above the magic number of 52.4. Unit percent: 18-31. 58 percent. Year to date: up 1.56 units<|endoftext|>OMG!!!!!!!!!!! YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON TO SEE THIS!!!!!!!! I TOLD EVERYONE<|endoftext|>Biden is getting a lot of play by going against Steyer.<|endoftext|>A pitch to Hill and he runs laterally, loses 3 and the clock stops but only momentarily.<|endoftext|>We have just begun level 4, 200-400 with a 400 ante. I have 45K.<|endoftext|>It is a prayer that the President makes a swift recovery from this lethal virus, that's what this fucking bullshit is, Jason.<|endoftext|>Rahm's 4th now from behind the green. He will have to execute a bump and run. And he hits it into the face of the bank but it freezes. He needs an up-and-down for bogey. AND HE HOLES IT FOR PAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>He finds the corner and its 1-1.<|endoftext|>And now a very big 3rd and 2 at the 20. Holy cow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>The chillen was always the worst to see, and them that had rickets and shaking all the time as if it was cold though it wasn't at all, just shaking like the old, but then just young chillen, and the doctor says the boy needs protein. But no milk. They pore it all away.<|endoftext|>Swing and a miss. 0-2.<|endoftext|>WATCHES THE STRIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Hey, @ACR_POKER, what the hell is Cave Live? And is it a beach tourney because it’s in Costa Rica?<|endoftext|>See you there, Andrew. I guess I should be calling you Andy now right?<|endoftext|>That was not a TD by Murray. He went in motion at the last moment and the ball was snapped directly to Sermon, who scored.<|endoftext|>from your mouth to Ted's ear.<|endoftext|>42 tics to go.<|endoftext|>At 16, a fine shot by Bryson and not much of an effort by Rahm.<|endoftext|>A miss by Philly and Boston down by 2.<|endoftext|>And now another one in the dirt is the payoff pitch. Maltanado saves this one and there are two men on now with only the one out.<|endoftext|>Hahahahaha. You are correct, 5-iron-breath!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>He needs game where he scores more than 3.44 TDs obviously. Now, he just scored his 4th of the night which brings him up to 35 TDs for the season.He would need to finish this game with 37.88 to keep pace, so he would need 7, a record for a single game.<|endoftext|>BALL IS OUT. TURNOVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And how about this for a stat. The New York football Giants have gone 15 straight missed third downs. WOW!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Lakers up by 2.<|endoftext|>Count is 2-2. Crowd on its feet looking for a K to end this one.<|endoftext|>Well-used timeout to grab the first down.<|endoftext|>That's the opposite of the Golden Rule. Check your KJV,<|endoftext|>Correa at bat.<|endoftext|>Sorry, Djoko is returning≥<|endoftext|>Bautista is serving for the set and up15-0.<|endoftext|>Bernie says that m officers are snatching babies from their mothers. I keep hearing this but would love to see a video. Sounds hysterical.<|endoftext|>Sorry, racist, I'm going to have to block you.<|endoftext|>There should be a pitching change but there isn't one. Surprising.<|endoftext|>My mistake for the confusion. I am definitely taking Tsitsipas tonight. I am laying off him winning The Aussie Open, but I think at 12-1 he's a great value.<|endoftext|>Game number 4 and Nadal has yet to lead!!!!!!!!! e faces another break at 30-40<|endoftext|>Just turned on the debate to hear Bernie rail against childhood poverty. I'm no economist but aren't all children broke?<|endoftext|>BREAK POINT NUMBER 2!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Inside but Springer fouls it off.<|endoftext|>And he takes the next 3 to take the point.<|endoftext|>The Lightning bet is a loss so that makes the Blackhawk(O1.5) a 4-star pick.<|endoftext|>AND HOW WAS THAT FOR DRAMA!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Norm Macdonald, Still in Search of the Perfect Joke<|endoftext|>Give your head a shake. Salinger is the only original voice in Literature in the last half-century. When teenagers read it in school they are shook. A book that speaks not only for them, but through them.<|endoftext|>GRAND SLAM HOME RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Can Jeffress come up with another K here?<|endoftext|>My mistake. 30-15.<|endoftext|>Johnson tries a play action but it is sniffed out and Johnson has to scrabble away to prevent the sack.<|endoftext|>The early-morning groups started on fire but have slowed down since. VERY GOOD NEWS FOR TIGER!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>it always seems to find something.<|endoftext|>Sabathia's first pitch just touches the sleeve of Benintendi, but that is enough to send the lead-off man on first. That is Boston's fifth baserunner now. Sabathia has gotten out of the first two innings with stranded men but those players reached base with 2 outs. No outs here.<|endoftext|>Thanks so much. I'm here now. Do you know, MacKenzie, that they are trying to get the Olympics here again?<|endoftext|>Jackie bBradley Junior comes to the plate.<|endoftext|>Ball is handed to Williams and he races to midfield.<|endoftext|>Oostie birdies and he is at -4.<|endoftext|>Sandoo's Special minutes away now!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Back at 13, Tiger has also laid up.<|endoftext|>@matthewrlindsey Matt? Buddy? I'm not making an arguement.<|endoftext|>HENRY TAKES IT TO THE 20!!!!!!!! FIRST DOWN!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Let's not forget Judge Reinhold!!!!!!I guess all of us are guilty of this.<|endoftext|>Before the sea is no more, before the night is no more, before hunger and thirst and tears are no more, before what is becomes the used to be, by which is meant now, be zealous lest ye be reproved.<|endoftext|>AND NOW A BREAK POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Make art 5-1<|endoftext|>And Peralta walks him.<|endoftext|>A hand off and a lateral run for -2.<|endoftext|>none of those men get together with Fat Joe on the weekends and laugh it up on their boats and drink champagne and eat so much meat they can't eat any more so they throw it to the dogs. Christ, no. These men are more like you and me.<|endoftext|>Fritelli began his round late yesterday on the. back 9. After bogeying 12, he eagled the par 5 13th, then rattled off 3 straight. birdies to get into that logjam at -4. This morning he birdied the first and second holes and now stands at the 5th tee box ne back of Casey at -6.<|endoftext|>From 30 feet and he slides it by. Now, he may have dragged the cut-line back to even. We'll wait and see.<|endoftext|>Thank you, Renee. Hope you and your hubby enjoyed the show!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Runs it again, picks up the needed yard. First down.<|endoftext|>Hahaha. Would have been more fun for SOMEONE to get it!!!!! Where were you, bud?<|endoftext|>AND HE DRPOS IT!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Hey, OJ, it's Norm. Listen, be careful about the videos you put out there. I recognize the golf course behind your house I know that exact street and could easily print your address. Of course I never would, but others would. Be careful, Juice.<|endoftext|>Goff throws it away. 6 minutes left in the opening quarter.<|endoftext|>Lost the Monday Night game by the hook. What a game. And, now, would ESPN please track Mahone as he is on pace to tie the record of Peyton Manning.<|endoftext|>The tournament begins momentarily.<|endoftext|>@MacroCharting A memoir is what you remember. What was written was what was remembered.<|endoftext|>Thank you so much, Mary. Those sections were by far the toughest.<|endoftext|>Bill, I would have reached out to you on DM but you don't follow me. As a matter of fact, that may be the problem, Pallie. You just don't follow me, which is fine. But don't Eddie Coyle me.<|endoftext|>And what started as a promising drive ends in a turnover on downs as the opening quarter ends<|endoftext|>Back in the 90's I used to rib my pal @TheRealOJ32 on the TV. And, now, we are here in Vegas. I've never golfed with The Juice. It might be fun.<|endoftext|>TIGER TAPS IN THE BIRDIE. HE'S TWO BACK!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Molinari misses the short putt.<|endoftext|>A run for 3 aND THJE 2 ,IMNUTE WARNING HAPPENS.<|endoftext|>Jansen keeps tossing it over to first to keep Perez from the steal. There is no way, with Yelich at the plate, that Perez will steal.<|endoftext|>Same way you get used to anything, you know what I mean. But me, I never got used to it. it always made that breakfast taste a little sour, if that makes any goddam sense.<|endoftext|>@wildwAAland @MattStoutPoker Only one, @MattStoutPoker. Next table and you called with third pair to scoop. It comes. It goes. Great playing with you.<|endoftext|>@AJ_Jones_Author Yes, you are reading the room wrong. I was asked a question by @Knightofrule. I was trying to respond the best I could. No reason tho be concerned, Pallie.<|endoftext|>And this time they give Lawrence way too much time and he delivers a laser to Ross for a big gain. Lawrence had one other big gain earlier for a TD and thats the difference in this contest.<|endoftext|>That was about 4 minutes a game.<|endoftext|>13700 on the button. About 20 BBS.<|endoftext|>Dustin has a hammerlock on Augusta but when the smoke clears I choose, Im, down by 4 right now. Pick him if you can play live odds. He pays 15-1 and I guarantee he will win or be very close. I'm going to load up on him. Good luck, friend.<|endoftext|>BIG RUN TO THE 15!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>2nd inning, and 3-up 3-down 3-up 3-down. on to the 3rd, Sox 1 Astros 0<|endoftext|>Hahahahaha. That's awesome, Mark.<|endoftext|>Finds the inside spot for a strike.<|endoftext|>You're a good man Ethan. And a very creative man as well.<|endoftext|>And that brings Pearce to the plate.<|endoftext|>No. it makes no sense in the audiobook.<|endoftext|>And Peralta is working hard, here, and it doesn't get easier as he now faces Justin Turner.<|endoftext|>He begins with a long pass incomplete.<|endoftext|>I would like to issue a warning about my picks. I am so far 16-23, which is 69.5%. I am doing even better with my star system, at 41-56, for 73%, meaning through 23 wagers my system shows a profit of 46 units. These are astounding numbers and are due for a correction.<|endoftext|>" So as I leave you, I'll just remind you what you'll be missing. You don't have Trump to kick you around anymore." : Line from Trump's concession speech.<|endoftext|>Thank you so much, Russel. By the way, I'm thinking of selling the remaining hardcovers myself. They've become a collectors item and I've been told may very well rise in cost. So, if you have a hardcover keep it in pristine shape. I'll keep mine as an investment, may sell a few.<|endoftext|>Haha, Thanks so much, girl.<|endoftext|>Taylor takes the whole way and the pitch barely finds the strike zone. 3-1.<|endoftext|>Hahaha. Al remembers everything. Check out the crazy game show on youtube.<|endoftext|>And now, Tiger from there bunker. NEARLY HOLES THE EAGLE!!!!!!!!!! A TAP-IN BIRDIE GETS TIGER TO -5<|endoftext|>How great was Keaton?<|endoftext|>Nothing wrong with them, don't get me wrong, and I always left a buck for them, same way I would for Brucker or one of the other ladies. Thing about these guys, these little guys, they never showed no shame about it About the cash or credit thing, you know.<|endoftext|>And the first play by Russel Wilson is a hand-off t Carson and he fumbles. Just like that, the pack will have it in the red zone, as Clay Matthews knocks the ball loose.<|endoftext|>Miley, at the plate now, fights the count full.<|endoftext|>Restaurant opened at 6, pretty well perfect, get in, take seat at the counter, man splashed coffee in every cu0p right down the line then reach for the ear, take the pencil, and what'll you haves dn the special, ever time the special, what else for God's sake.<|endoftext|>Central comes right back and takes the 3-1 lead.<|endoftext|>First break is in 18 minutes. That will conclude level 2. 8 levels will be played today.<|endoftext|>Up ahead at the par 5, Cameron Smith crushes his tee shot at the par 5 13th but it dribbles into the first cut. Abad break.<|endoftext|>From the 25.<|endoftext|>I'm thankful that the LAPD and the Burbank Police put aside any egos to work together and finally solve the baffling murder of Bob Hope.<|endoftext|>It took Djoko only two hours. This domination of the number 2 seed by the number 1 seed may not have precedent. The number one player and number 2 player in the world. What does this'll mean?<|endoftext|>Make it 40-15 and Bautista will have 2 straight serves to get into his first quarter of a major.<|endoftext|>Rivers hands it off to get a first down to begin quarter 2.<|endoftext|>firs two pitches well outside and, now, Sale is behind again. WHY IS THERE NO ACTION IN THE BULLPEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!?<|endoftext|>When they return from the break it will e second and 8 and Johnson and the Skins will fittingly have the ball at the 50 yard line, with the season of both teams at stake.<|endoftext|>AD Djoko and he forces Rafa to his backhand and Raf hits it low into the net.<|endoftext|>Rahm saves another par to remain one back.<|endoftext|>@paulsado I can't wait for this. When does it drop, Paully?<|endoftext|>I am mot a political person. I have no dog in the fight. I'm in it for the long game. But, someone told me Trump called Tim Cook Tim Apple. I watched it. He didn't. Meaningless whether he did or not. But... He did not. #Normsnotpolitical<|endoftext|>if people only understood that I have never uttered anything in public that was not a punchline or a set-up (and that includes this), and that I have never shared a single thing I truly believe with a stranger, then they will know. I'm no truth-teller. I tell only lies.<|endoftext|>BREAKING ALERT: THERE IS A NINE-WAY TIE AT FIRST WITH -9!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And that is all it was.<|endoftext|>@morgan_murphy Hahaha. You rule, girl.<|endoftext|>You can see the confidence @rumnchess is playing with when you look at the hand he folded the q-q to Samartino's 4-bet. He was derided by many on social media who forget the players don't get to see the down cards. The fold was telling.<|endoftext|>So Bryson is back on the tightrope. He is on the cut. line now with one to play.<|endoftext|>Dan, I just re-read my tweets and you are completely right and I wrong. Sincere apology. I would like a cilvil conversation with you.<|endoftext|>I met Richard Lewis, a comedy genius of the highest order, and I met Louis CK. I started out doing stand-up with the avant-garde Bruce McCullough, and through him, met The Kids in the Hall, who changed the direction in comedy more than anyone in the 90's.<|endoftext|>Randy, I love you baby.<|endoftext|>Williams a basket and one.<|endoftext|>Cameron Smith just birdied after a birdie and an eagle. He is coming to his final hole, one back.<|endoftext|>In the group behind, Webb and Matsuyama join Leishman for a star-studded affair.<|endoftext|>A pass for 6 and 3rd and 10. Can the Sooners force the punt/<|endoftext|>From the right out of bounds line, he cuts inward to the middle of the feilf and crosses the mid-stripe.<|endoftext|>Checking out "The Loudest Voice", and a thought came to me. When I was young, I loved Mel Blanc, who created so many fully realized comedic characters. Then came Jim Henson. And now another capable of creating an entire comedy universe, the great @SethMacFarlane. I've been lucky.<|endoftext|>I've lost the weekly pool. however, if KC prevails, I move ahead on the season standings with 10 wins to Trimbles 5 wins. However, Mahomes has been strip sacked again.<|endoftext|>Goddma, Doug, you're a good man to say such a thing. I'm writing every day, and then I scribble this stuff down and it gets such a response. Maybe I'm going about writing the whole wing way. Maybe I should just write about the life I lived before I stopped. Anyway, thanks, pal.<|endoftext|>Watches it but it is called. Inning over. Bottom of the 9th coming up, Brewers need a run to keep alive in this one. Dodgers lead 4-3.<|endoftext|>Hey, did Jeffrey Epstein commit suicide? He was on suicide watch. Impossible. was he murdered by his rich and powerful freinds?<|endoftext|>3rd and 1 for Green Bay.<|endoftext|>The bEagles will get the ball first to begin the second half. The ball is kneeled in the end zone.<|endoftext|>And 55 may be the limit here.<|endoftext|>Cooler heads prevail within the coaching staff. A nice punt and Washington will have the entire feild to negotiate<|endoftext|>@ACmadschool do you guys know if Randy Dash has a twitter account. I can't seem to find him.<|endoftext|>Lakers look like they will win this one here in OT<|endoftext|>@hqtrivia storm90094 buy more extra lives<|endoftext|>top of the 3rd, and 2 quick outs powwowed by two walks followed by an out. Bottom of the third and the Astros scoreless.<|endoftext|>It's time for the stretch but please remember I predicted this game would go at least 14 innings and it will.<|endoftext|>I have 15 K left, a half-stack. Been card-dead all day blinds are 3-6 K with 100 blind<|endoftext|>What a delightful boy to meet. Made my day, his open smile, fearing none and loving all.<|endoftext|>Armstrong walks off under his own power after a crushing hit to the jaw and neck area. Very good news there.<|endoftext|>Wentz looking to the end zone and THERE IS HERTZ. ALL ALONE.<|endoftext|>Hollywood's tough on the living, but it sure does speak well of the dead.<|endoftext|>Carnac has spoken!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>You're quoting A;vy Singer. Hahaha. You rally think there is an end to everything. Again, you only mean the end of man, because that is as far as you can see.<|endoftext|>Hey, is it just me or do these people NOT like Donald Trump?<|endoftext|>The Houston Astros started this post-season with such momentum, taking the first 4 games handily. But they have lost the last 3 and Boston is now seven outs away from The World Series.<|endoftext|>In that case, filling first base to put the double-play in effect, turns out to cost the defense a run. If there had been runners at second and third the runner at third would not have been running.<|endoftext|>I've been laughing a great deal the last few days as memories of my many conversations with Super Dave come to me. I knew him for 30 years and never called him Bob. People forget how incredibly funny the name itself is. "Super Dave". Think about it. So so funny. " Super Dave"<|endoftext|>I've chipped up to 340K at The Venom at @ACR<|endoftext|>I'll tell you who is not afraid of Climate Change? Robots!!!!!!! #YangGang<|endoftext|>Hey, Tom. Hey Kelly. WRONG<|endoftext|>A weirdly hit chopper to third base and it gets caught up in the grass after a big first bounce, infield hit.<|endoftext|>And now a run for 8 and Oklahoma better come up with something quick. It looked like they had that when they came up with a turnover, forcing a fumble from Bama when they had the ball second and goal at the one.<|endoftext|>I'm sorry for your loss, Lane. If u ever want to see my show live, DM me.<|endoftext|>And. So, the second team to have the ball in OT, effectively, gets an extra down on every single possession. They are playing a different game. The rules committee aren’t so dumb after all. @ColinCowherd @TheHerd<|endoftext|>after a fantastic job last week, a very disappointing beginning here. 2 losses on football and, early on, a hope to pushing roundball.<|endoftext|>And he is out!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@chadzumock @kevinbrennan666 Yeah, sure, love to do it.<|endoftext|>Second outside. 2-0.<|endoftext|>AND FEDERET TAKES ANOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>In the Masters 4-tier pool, I have Xander, Hadwin, Lefty and Tommy Fleetwood.<|endoftext|>Aguilar is up and a full count.<|endoftext|>Here is a prediction.This game will go extra innings.<|endoftext|>The Idiocy of Hope.<|endoftext|>FINAU GETS UP AND DOWN!!!!!!!! HE IS -10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@iamcolinquinn Wait, what's going on? Colin? What's this all about. When I was a kid they talked about impeachment as well. The only difference was the guy they wanted to impeach was Richard Nixon. Oh, wait. maybe it's not so different after all.<|endoftext|>Let us take a look. Casey leads with -6. Westwood, who I said not to give up on, up at the top as well, and Tiger 2 back at -4.<|endoftext|>And Bautista has tied it up. It has turned into a ladies match, 2 out of 3.<|endoftext|>Our stupid little show are getting incredible reviews. Here is Roseanne. Enjoy and stay safe.<|endoftext|>10-10 as Federer wins easily.<|endoftext|>Here comes the fifth pitch.<|endoftext|>Joking around with the great Eli Elezra in Nassau. But, seriously, there is not a game Eli is not a master of. If you are a poker fan, a pro, or a recreational player, you MUST buy this book, NOW!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>They are stretched, and Matt Barnes is in here to try to keep the Astros from being introduced to the scoreboard. First batter is Correa and he is dispatched with 7 pitches, Here, now, Gurriel.<|endoftext|>I assume if it is overturned it means point Djoko. But I'm pretty sure it means Djoko gets his first serve again. Anyway they are looking at ball-tracker.<|endoftext|>Count goes to 2-1 and Torres drives it to deep left center but Benitendi tracks it down. One out.<|endoftext|>I have not gambled on sports. I did join the Vegas super contest where you pick 5 a week. Worst I've done is 2-3. With the win Thursday, my record improved to 26-15. my buddy at 23-18. This weekend I have Pats, Seahawks, Bears and Ravens. My buddy has Pats, Fins, Steelers, Ravens<|endoftext|>Eagles still with a timeouts will keep the offense out there.<|endoftext|>it didn't take much for either of them to get here. But now, here they are.<|endoftext|>My mother and I are doing an Instagram QandA. Follow me at<|endoftext|>And, of course Ricky Fowler should beat Justin Rose.<|endoftext|>Final at the 10th continues his blistering pace and is looking at a birdie to start the back 9. BUT MISSES!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I'll tell you what the cash or credit hing was all about o you understand what chafed me about the whole racket. And that's what it was buddy, and I knew it and they knew it and everybody knew it. It was a goddam racket.<|endoftext|>But instead it is a poppet. 6 up-6 down for the bullpen. Yankees will be down to 6 batters. But do not worry. The drama will come. Patience.<|endoftext|>A lot happening fast here. Im is finishing up his first round, one out of the lead. JT has begun his second round at the 10th, also at -6. The field is crammed up top.<|endoftext|>If DJ can manage a birdie here at 12th, this tourney may be over. And the 12th last Masters, was the hole Tiger won it on. This year Tiger didn't do quite as well, carding a 10 at the par 3.<|endoftext|>What a terrible break for Bryson. He is heading back to the tee box to hit his third.<|endoftext|>THAT IS THE SECOND STRAIGHT BATTER OSUNA HAS HIT AND THAT WILL WALK IN A MAN.<|endoftext|>Always dangerous punt when OBJ is standing there.<|endoftext|>First reason the second team has the advantage in OT. They know what they need. The first team gets a FG, then they need a FG to tie and a TD to win. The first team doesn’t score, the second team knows it does not need to score and needs only a FG to win. @ColinCowherd @TheHerd<|endoftext|>I like Andrew Yang the best because I'm a big fan of 1000 dollars.

I’m just shy of 35K.<|endoftext|>The warning happens.<|endoftext|>Grandson taking all the way. 3-1.<|endoftext|>And, indeed, it is 3 up, 3 down. Here is where the Yankees will come alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>A quick point for Rouille and Djoko serves, up 4-2.<|endoftext|>I forgot to wish you a happy birthday. Sorry, Michael. I miss you and think we should get together and talk about Bob and Ray and different things.<|endoftext|>I'm a very slow reader my own self, Jack, but that's the only way to read. What's the goddam hurry anyway. I always think of how long it took the author to write it, and I read it slow, slow, slow.<|endoftext|>Altube up to bat now and an easy out, but Springer did the damage.<|endoftext|>All the way back to the 35 and Lawrence runs for 12.<|endoftext|>An incredible catch.<|endoftext|>A run for zero.<|endoftext|>an 1-1 count and a deep fly ball is run down. Inning over. Brewers still ahead 2-0.<|endoftext|>The next reason the second team has such a huge advantage OT is a little more sophisticated. If the first team scores, the second team, knowing it must score, will play 4 downs. @ColinCowherd @TheHerd<|endoftext|>Absurd claim. Give your head a shake.<|endoftext|>Third and goal now.<|endoftext|>@IanBoothby Ian, do you mean people that are jerks who happen to be right-wing? Or do you mean people who are right-wing are automatically jerks?<|endoftext|>He is a first pitch hitter.<|endoftext|>2 minutes left. Lebron misses the three and Aldridge is fouled on the other end.<|endoftext|>Bryson ends the day now with a bogey and 1 74 for the day, even for the tourney. He'll have to wait and see whether he plays the weekend.<|endoftext|>And now Pouille will serve to see if he can pick up a point in the first set.<|endoftext|>First pitch by Verlander is outside and it is 1-0.<|endoftext|>People are always asking me who the new funny stand-ups are. Here is a fantastic one. Enjoy.Ryan Conner Stand-up via @YouTube<|endoftext|>Over the middle and a yard shy of first down. This would be a HUGE STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I was at the Beto O’Rourke town hall to hear about prison reform and watch what happened!! #freefelicity<|endoftext|>Hahaha. I have that effect on some powerful producers.<|endoftext|>Tsitsipas loses the first two points now and fins himself down 0-30.<|endoftext|>AND THE FIRST IS DONE. DJOKO WINS IT 6-0 .<|endoftext|>Rahm with a perfect shot.<|endoftext|>It’s tied with 8:37 left. Target is 3:00 Mark now. Total is 2. That means 5 to beat me.<|endoftext|>I first saw him when I was a boy in Ottawa where he hosted Reach For The Top. I was a game-show junkie and followed his career avidly.

No score.<|endoftext|>Thanks, everybody, for supporting me. Sold out in 6 hours. Gonna make you proud, and hopefully make you money. Tweet me, now, you hear.<|endoftext|>QB run and they are short<|endoftext|>Still BREAK POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>PENALTY ON SAN JOSE!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>So many players in contention. Jason Day just missed a very makable eagle.<|endoftext|>Point number one goes to Tsitsipas as Bautista has to use his second serve.<|endoftext|>And now the ball handed to Smallwood, who runs it for 5, and the ball is suddenly all the way to the 10. Smallwood gets the ball again but goes nowhere. 2nd and goal.<|endoftext|>Thank you, Jake.<|endoftext|>Its 2nd and 17 and encroachment makes it 2nd and 12.<|endoftext|>Pops it into the seats behind the third base dugout. 0-2.<|endoftext|>Tiger just misses!!!!!!!! He taps in for birdie and get to -8. Koepka has just birdied, and is also one back at -8.<|endoftext|>back from the Rio and now I can talk about the WSOP.<|endoftext|>HENRY WITH A BIG 9-YARD RUN AFTER IT LOOKED LIKE NOTHING!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Yeah, Tim,I thought was astonishingly good. Agree with you on the cast and, by far, best thing Sam Waterston has ever done..<|endoftext|>Tsitsipas has just broken Bautista and has it back on serve. I hope you took my lock of the year. 4-4 in the first set.<|endoftext|>I’m down to 35 K<|endoftext|>And now Bryson.<|endoftext|>I never did see it, only said I did, and have been saying it all these years, but at least never talked myself into believing I saw it, not like some that were there that night. But I was there. Yes I was. The night Busher Shane Jackson threw a man's life out a window,<|endoftext|>And in you were and the laughter and the chatter and the gossip and the anger and dance and the dance and the dance.<|endoftext|>My goodness. Only 3K short a million. I have a bet on the exact day the odometer turns.<|endoftext|>False modesty disallows me from mentioning BOATS, certainly the greatest comic novel ever. But Portis had a body of work, which counts for a lot. It is why I left off Salinger and O’Toole.<|endoftext|>To be clear I have 100 dollars in chips. Blind is 25. I may have to rebuy.<|endoftext|>Took 4 hours to decide this one. The Dodgers have won most games this season but The Brewers have taken 11 straight.<|endoftext|>Holding. First down. Oh my goodness.<|endoftext|>And a throw for 6.<|endoftext|>Casey, your leader, looks like he will make a sand save and not give a hole away.<|endoftext|>Barkley takes it home.<|endoftext|>Pliskova has fought off Match Point after Match Point after Match point, after being down 5-1 in the final set. She now is serving for the match and has it 40-0. Here we go as now Serena will face 3 match points although that is very unlikely. This is over.<|endoftext|>Betts at bat with a 2-2 count.<|endoftext|>Bellinger comes up to the plate and pops it up to end the inning, but that inning gave the Dodgers its first lead.<|endoftext|>Very true. Also, Irishman made the interesting choice of having the young Deniro and young Pesci shuffle around like old men and talk with old men’s voices, creating a fascinating dissonance that was never annoying. Not Goodfellas.<|endoftext|>TD RODGERS TO JONES!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Watches another ball and is ahead 2-1.<|endoftext|>Eagles start at its 15, a hand-off and an incomplete pass leads to a third and 4 for Went. From the shotgun, the underneath pass snagged by Hertz, but he is crushed by Ogletrre just short.<|endoftext|>Congrats, Doc. How wonderful. This is Norm Macdonald, just another comedian with a podcast. Please DM me if you would, sir.<|endoftext|>Almost a home run, but now Hicks is in the hole 0-2. It still feels like he will prevail here.<|endoftext|>@Brian_Mack @JudgeJudy yeah, you saw it?'<|endoftext|>Notre Dame 3 and out.<|endoftext|>Westwood ties for the lead!!!!!!! and Schwarzel is getting devoured by the bear trap so momentarily it will be Im and Westwood alone at top.<|endoftext|>Sorry, Ron. I'll stop.<|endoftext|>And they ever does ay you back you're thanking him and he's doing you the favor. t's an ugly thing, a thing like that. I know a guy, monte, he won't talk to his brother no more. His own brother. so that tells you how ugly it is. how unfair. Like a chigger of sour milk.<|endoftext|>And the catcher calls a timeout right before the pitcher threw a wild pitch. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>From the 32, first down is incomplete.<|endoftext|>DeChambeau makes a great shot from an awful lie and he will have a very good chance at a birdie on the final hole of the championship. But I just don't believe he can close and that is why I guaranteed he would lose when everyone was saying it was a slam-dunk.<|endoftext|>DJ from the fairway at 11th. And he has missed right and his ball rests. Right along where Smith put his second and ended up with a bogey. Next to play is Im.<|endoftext|>and good that he did as a review shows it was, indeed long. And now Tsitsipas faces another break serve.<|endoftext|>Another good run, but another penalty. First and 25.<|endoftext|>Puig comes to the plate. Still nobody out, so even a double-play, without going home, would score a run.<|endoftext|>Im punches it out<|endoftext|>Aaron Boone goes to the bench and sends McCutcheon to the plate. He watches the first two pitches as well and it is 1-1.<|endoftext|>Top of the 6th now, and with 2 out, the top of the order for L.A.<|endoftext|>@AltcoinDailyio 75 % btc, 15% etc, 10% alt<|endoftext|>BREAKING ALERT; IM SAVES PAR, REMAINS 4 BACK.<|endoftext|>Please help to free a woman who has been incarcerated for 14 years in a federal penitentiary for the unforgivable crime of providing a decent education for her child.

MAN LIVES BY BREAD!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Norm, I know your work, it's brilliant. How do you think the work you did on The Kids in the Hall holds up. Because I think it holds up fine, as brilliant as when it was written. Not sure it could be written today. Your job would be taken from you, Norm. From you.<|endoftext|>See, what people don't know about the depression is that there was food that weren't give to the hongry. That's a fact. Yessir. Man is bad as the dirt in times like them. Them killing chickens and cows while poor chillen starve.<|endoftext|>Now , suppose you're a man and you own a business upstairs and there's another man and he own a business downstairs, say a diner, you don't think those men don't know each other.<|endoftext|>3 straight balls to the lead-off man.<|endoftext|>And he sails one over the second basemen's outstretched hand and is standing on first. When will the Dodger's remove Ryu. Seems time.<|endoftext|>And so Turner will have to face Corbin Burnes.<|endoftext|>2 minutes to go in the opening quarter.<|endoftext|>Djokovitch quickly ties. 2-2.<|endoftext|>You see, that restaurant downstairs from the temporary manpower joint, they charged 4 bucks for the breakfast special and that was Jacki it was no big going outta business she or nothin, but it was jack and I never had a complaint;<|endoftext|>But recovers. NY's ball.<|endoftext|>Down the middle inside and Turner jumps on it. line drive is deep.<|endoftext|>DJ at the tee box on 13 and a fine shot goes a little right but stops in the second cut before the pine straw. JT finds the pine straw and Cantlay, with the best, bisects the fairway.<|endoftext|>Thanks so much, Miranda.<|endoftext|>Federer shanks the first.<|endoftext|>I forgot that bit from the book. Thank's , Joshua. I appreciate it.<|endoftext|>And, now , Poille is serving and facing double set point.<|endoftext|>Need under 31 in this last quarter. Stranger things have never happened.<|endoftext|>Rahm, coming in as one of the big favorites, tied with Tiger and has a long birdie putt at 6. Missed but a tap-in and he will remain. at -4.<|endoftext|>But, after a long and powerful volley, Rafa with an awful backhand misses by a foot. 40-30<|endoftext|>Would be good to go scoreless Tge first ten minutes.<|endoftext|>Rodgers starts the drive st the 25 and tosses a 15 yarder.<|endoftext|>It was amazing to see my good and great friend, the good and great Bob Uecker joining the booth on Fox in the third inning.

The second picture is pickle_the_kitty_cat! Both great cats (I assume... I’ve never met Pickle), but Pickle has over one hundred followers!!! Do you guys think Kitty could be…<|endoftext|>Another breaker and again Bregman lays off. Count is even.<|endoftext|>Nadal is rarely in this situation.And he gets to serve first here in the second set.<|endoftext|>DeChambeau has to lay up from out of the woods and Rahm decides to lay up. Both will have tough 3rd shots.<|endoftext|>She'd wail, God, why did you forsake us. We always tried as hard as we could to do what the good book commands. But now, two of my chillen, in bags underneath the ground and my husband diggin another hole, the third hole, and he can barely get through it, Lord, for the pain.<|endoftext|>I like Caruana.<|endoftext|>@NickSchulman Nick, I hope you are having a great time during the holy days.

I am not going to tune in while the discussion is live so please don't be self-conscious.<|endoftext|>I appreciate you read the book carefully. it took such a great deal out of me and so I am so happy that the book reached you. Read it again. It was not written t be read once.<|endoftext|>Tiger with some bad luck on the third as his drive finds a divot, but his approach is imaginative. I love Tiger's game plan so far. Sail along at even, and then take the birdies when they fall.<|endoftext|>And a run of 8.<|endoftext|>Oh, no!!!!!!! I missed my stories today.<|endoftext|>Meanwhile Justin Thomas has dropped a shot and there are 4 tied on the top. Thomas and Van Rooyen still have the edge, being in the ultimate game.<|endoftext|>Sat down raised first hand in hijack, button reraised I folded. Second hand, called a raise got reraised and folded on the flop<|endoftext|>So there are a lot of players out at Augusta who are finishing their first round. One who deserves are consideration is the young unknown from South. Africa, Dylan Fritelli.<|endoftext|>And we reach the first break point since the first game of this match!!!!!!! it is 30-40 2-3, Tsitsipas trying to avoid the break. Let's watch.<|endoftext|>@RonTheWhip Oh, I know. But the knowledge does nothing to lessen.<|endoftext|>Well, the chance of any single player winning is doubtful. But someone has to win. And I agree. Second to a Tiger win would be a 5-man playoff.<|endoftext|>The kickoff is dramatic as The Ginat's Davis runs it back. Tackled at the 30.<|endoftext|>A handoff for zero and the clock runs under 7:30, that's half way through quarter 1.<|endoftext|>Fouls off another, and the pitch count up to 73 now.<|endoftext|>Played a fantastic theatre in a town out of the Twilight Zone (Next Stop, Tarrytown).

A long volley that ends with a cross court to Nadal who makes a very courageous shot down the line. And he shouts in exultation, looking to the crowd for noise. AND HR GETS IT!!!!!!!! He will not go gently into this good set.<|endoftext|>Beer came in pitchers and when it was your turn to get the round you were happy and pulled out the 20 and got a bunch of little ones back.

What are you doing on your birthday today?<|endoftext|>Peterson picks up 1. under 10 minutes left in regulation.

It's aa about attitude.<|endoftext|>Final taps in for par at the 14th and is -10 with the 15th next!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Mama begins a nice drive but a holding call stops them.

LeBron is fouled.<|endoftext|>Lakers went on an 8-0 run and now have it tied with 4 minutes left in OT, but mark my words, they will LQSE!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>15-15. Dijon serves and volleys and Rafa, with Djoko standing at the net tried to take it down the line but found net. 30-15<|endoftext|>BREAKING NEWS!!!!!!!!! Cameron Champ has just followed a bogey at 7 with an eagle at 8, and sits at -8, one shot back.<|endoftext|>It took 16 last point 18 this. 4-4.<|endoftext|>I'm not a Trumper, William. Not at all. But telling that you think anyone wishing the President a swift recovery is a Trumper<|endoftext|>make sit 15-30 two hours and 40 into this match.<|endoftext|>That missed extra point by Washington hurts when the total is 40 for the game, and 20 for the second half.<|endoftext|>That punt was for all of 35 yards and so far the Sooners have done everything, and I mean everything wrong.<|endoftext|>@DrJustinbass I struggle daily.<|endoftext|>What an honor. Im a lucky man.<|endoftext|>@GordieMcDonald It was always your first love, Gord.<|endoftext|>KEOPKA"S CHIP AT THE par 5 JUST MISSES.<|endoftext|>@vealchuc Sorry, csnider, I don't understand what you mean?<|endoftext|>TIGER NOW FOR EAGLE!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Pass to Locket. All the way to the 15.<|endoftext|>In golf, cheating is constant. It is just that most do not have cameras trained on them.<|endoftext|>Tatum makes it 5 and we need the next one.<|endoftext|>And it is a long out. Nothing more. We'll go to the ninth. Dodgers lead 4-3.<|endoftext|>Lose again next hand. Here’s how it went down. Sane player raises. I re-raise on the button with A-Q and get called. Flop is 10-4-4. I bet, get called. K on the turn. Check check. River brings a bet and Zi fold.<|endoftext|>DJ is now at -15. I still say Im will win.<|endoftext|>Jansen takes 2 strikes and the third pitch is in the dirt, 2-1.<|endoftext|>So, that swing was huge because it changes the situation from 2 on nobody out to 1 one 1 out. Wow.<|endoftext|>Down to 20K<|endoftext|>I love people that are in to pure comedy and that is @morgan_murphy. It is her only agenda and she is going to create something very special. Pure funny. There are only a few in the whole world. That's how special she is.<|endoftext|>A long volley and RAF WINS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>BREAKING ALERT; DJ PUTTING POR BIRDIE ON THE 12TH FROM 18 FEET!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Tiger now about 90 away.<|endoftext|>AND A CHALLENGE!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>2nd and 15, 1:24 left.<|endoftext|>Strikes him out.<|endoftext|>The Chateau Laurier is a beautiful elegant hotel. It is part of The Big Three that define's our nation's capital along with the Rideau Canal, and of course The Parliament Buildings. Also, I did my first gig outside Yuks there. Must be saved. Please RT this as often as possible.<|endoftext|>He drives it the same place Voit did and just misses the HR. It is foul.<|endoftext|>Down and away and fills the count.<|endoftext|>Yeah, I was really hoping to get to know him when he stayed at my place. But I was on the goddam road too much. But just a beautiful guy.<|endoftext|>And, so, finally, you gotta bring it up. And then he starts coming up with excuses and how he doesn't have it right now but he's gonna get it and that you should stop worrying.<|endoftext|>No wonder no one likes journalists. This moron just learned a new word, and like most idiots with a new word. can't help but use it as often as possible, even when it means the opposite of his usage. Check your OED, Hedda Hopper.<|endoftext|>@LaughShopYYC Hey, guys, what's up? I miss you.<|endoftext|>They're only 3 minutes in.<|endoftext|>And Tiger just misses. He has 2 left.<|endoftext|>You liked the book, Adrian?<|endoftext|>Pray for the speedy recovery of the President and the First Lady. If prayer is beyond your moral scope, then at least find it in your heart not to laugh.<|endoftext|>@bobsaget Happy Birthday, Bob, What are you doing for your birthday.<|endoftext|>And on the next point Djok sends a long flat shot with backspin and Rafa fires it into the net. 15-30.<|endoftext|>DeChambeau ready to putt now.<|endoftext|>And again 3-0.<|endoftext|>Mahomes onto the field and the 50 yard line.<|endoftext|>JUMPS ON THE SECOND ONE AND IT IS VERY DEEP but he git under it and what looked like a two-run shot is caught at the warning tack. Houston needs 3 now and has two innings.<|endoftext|>And now, DeChambeau at the short par 4 18th.<|endoftext|>Here is an0other prediction. This game will go at least 14 innings.<|endoftext|>Dustin has a 20 footer with quite a break. And he has over read it. Back to IM<|endoftext|>This match is being played in The Rod Laver arena and over in The Margaret Court Arena, Cilic is playing in the fifth set and being challenged by the spaniard and the 22nd seeded Bautista and Cilic slips past a break point.<|endoftext|>4000 sales and @geoffedgers makes bestseller list. Read review, buy book!<|endoftext|>Here is a situation where there is no way that the umpire could have possibly seen that!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Some exciting things to announce soon, guys.<|endoftext|>Once again sets the table for DJ. This to get to double-digits under.<|endoftext|>Yang is telling everyone on national TV that the cxountgey is misogynist. Can't he keep his big trap shut?<|endoftext|>Bottom of the 13, 2 out as Guerrera is already up over 50 pitches as he sets to serve one to Bellinger. Full count.<|endoftext|>A BACKWARD K AND GONZALES STANDS STUNNED!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And so, what a great day. The TV boys were. discussing yesterday whether or not Tiger would make the cut. The boys in Vegas put Woods at 45-1. But I said emphatically that Tiger would defend this week and listened as. my twittered. told me I was an idiot. Will they never learn?<|endoftext|>I was at @ACR_POKER Cage L:ive in Costa Rica this August and had a blast. The last one this year starts December 4th. Check it out.<|endoftext|>Me, I'd just spit. I'm a God-fearin man, just like my daddy and his daddy before him. But I didn't buy these men as men of God. They was men of this world and all its meanness and they wanted what little we had for themselves.<|endoftext|>@benminer Where is Randy. Ive been trying to find him. Is he on twitter?<|endoftext|>deep, deep, and OUT OF THERE!!!!!!!! A SOLO SHOT TO GET THE CROWD ON ITS FEET!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And now back to Tiger with his long birdie putt at 15.<|endoftext|>Tsitsipas FIGHTS OFF ANOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>One period left. 20 minutes to go. Every minute that Padres is HUGE!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Count is 2-2 and the Yankee fans restless. They want out of this inning with no further damage.<|endoftext|>Very excited to report I have begun the process of adapting " Based on a True Story" into a film. I will report who will be collaborating on it with me and take you through the entire process. Peace, my brothers. And sisters. And sisters. I know. And sisters.<|endoftext|>Expect an upset today. The ML is the way to go, because you have my word on this. The National Championship will not be Alabama vs Clemson.<|endoftext|>DECHAMBEAU CARDS A TRIPLE AFTER WEIRDLY LOSE A GREAT TEE SHOT IN THE ROUGH!!!!!!!!! HE IS EVEN.<|endoftext|>The boys on TV are wondering whether or not Tiger will make the cut, with their sneering laughs. It is the same laugh they employed for years now when asked about Tiger's chance at a return. THEY ARE WRONG!!!!! TIGER WILL DEFEND!!!! TIGER WILL WIN!!!!!<|endoftext|>And now a strike. 2 out. Sanchez to the plate. He'd love a solo shot here.<|endoftext|>A picture, John, of the price, the terrible price.<|endoftext|>It would be good to have The Chargers stopped on this very first drive. Very big.<|endoftext|>Ok, getting the message. haha<|endoftext|>Trump is always being criticized for dividing people. But what about King Solomon?<|endoftext|>A quick out to begin the bottom of the 6th. And now Travis Shaw has hit one deep.<|endoftext|>And it is well, well out. Second serve.<|endoftext|>Look, at that @NekoCase . Keep just missing each other.<|endoftext|>Of course, I'm very thankful for being able to do stand-up comedy for a living, There is nothing more gratifying than to step on a stage before a quiet crowd and with only my jokes transform them into an unruly mob.<|endoftext|>Raonic came out like gangbusters but it’ll now he will go to the tie reak and be up 1 or down 1. Or good news to begin.<|endoftext|>Trouble for Tiger at 9.<|endoftext|>group 27 is certainly the greatest trio on the course tomorrow and it would surprise no one if the. champ came from this game and could be any of the three. Talking bout Dustin "of history" Johnson, Patrick "The Kid" Cantlay, and Rory "The Roar" McIlroy!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Final has put his second on the par 5 in the bunker.<|endoftext|>And now Tsitsipas takes an easy point and is ahead 5-4 and Federer will serve to stay in the set.<|endoftext|>FLEETWOOD BIRDIES FOR A 66. HE IS -7 NOW IN THE CLUBHOUSE.<|endoftext|>It took Tsitsipas 16 to win the last point and it may take more this point. IF he can prevail.<|endoftext|>My goodness. Bryson crushed the ball and it is somewhere in the rough, but incredibly he cannot find it.<|endoftext|>A 15 yard throw.<|endoftext|>Sale with his 81st pitch and, guess what. Fouls it off.<|endoftext|>THE VIDEO IS UP!!!! ENJOY AND SUBSCRIBE. Stay safe, my brothers.<|endoftext|>Michelson alo at 17 and also at -3, one behind the logjam of 4s. It will be interesting to watch the Phil-Tiger match ply as a game within a game.<|endoftext|>@kpfallon Hey, Kevin, a guy sent me your story on Geena Davis. So well-written. I am a huge fan of Davis's and wondered what had become of her. So sad. I tried to RT it but am computer-illiterate and messed it up. If you'd consider tweeting it to me I'd love to RT it. Great job!!<|endoftext|>Stop the purging. And stop the bingeing.<|endoftext|>15-30!!!!!!!!!!! And again<|endoftext|>Count is 2-2 and Turner chases it. the ball dribbles a few feet and they will have to go to first. The fielder's choice puts Taylor on first for Freese with one out.<|endoftext|>And the bottom of the order, Puig, Barnes and the pitcher Rich Hill, who has the perfect game going.<|endoftext|>You make a good point.<|endoftext|>The great Andrew Yang was a victim of being ahead of his time. Don't worry, pal, the nation will catch up. #YangGang2024<|endoftext|>@comicgeniustoo Sure, when the ATMs started charging you to take out your own money, I remember it and I remember us al saying we weren't gonna take it. Well, we took it.<|endoftext|>I loved talking to @MNightShyamalan. He can speak of his craft at a granular level that is beautiful. I think of our conversation often, pal. I would love to have you on the show again next year.<|endoftext|>Djokovitch serves for the first set.<|endoftext|>and there it was. He serves notice. The man to beat.<|endoftext|>And now DJ's 3rd.<|endoftext|>Full count. Wow.<|endoftext|>RTrimble has led for so long If the Chiefs had pulled it out, I would be 2 games back. But, no, I am 4 games back. But I am after him and, every week, I get closer. I will win this. Yessir, I will.<|endoftext|>91 yards in 15 plays. Easy money as they cover by the hook.<|endoftext|>Oh, no, I've played Fire Emblem Heroes many more hours than I've studied Exodus. I'm well aware of the King of Nohr.<|endoftext|>Bought in for 10K in chips. 13 minutes to end of rebuy. I@ just north of 40z<|endoftext|>How about this number to blow your mind. We are in the second inning, SAKE HAS PITCHED 45 PITCHES, and there is no score. WOW!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Swing and a miss. 1-2.<|endoftext|>I first saw The Frantics doing a gig at lunchtime at Ryerson, a University in Toronto. One of the few ties I ever sat in a University.<|endoftext|>Federer takes all the rest and they are tied at 9-9.<|endoftext|>Now I know it was only a job and that they didn't make the rules and that they didn't even benefit from the cash or credit ting.But none of them ever showed no shame for it, like I said before. And I don't know, maybe they did at the start and then they just got used to it.<|endoftext|>It was always my favorite time of the day. Nothing to do, nowhere to go. Big piece of cherry pie big heavy mug of coffee, cigarettes that were already rolled when you bought them. Leisure. No other word for it. Leisure. I loved dinner in that restaurant.<|endoftext|>Sorry about 5 K. Under the gun raised to 500 before the flop and everyone folded but the small blind who called. I called in the big blind with pocket 8s. The flop cane j-4-2 rainbow and I bet 1K. UTG called, small blind folded. Nothing on the turn I bet 1K UTG bade it 3K<|endoftext|>I lose a battle of the blinds and go to the button with 15K, about 39 big blinds. But there is 10 minutes left in this level and then it becomes 300/600 with 600 ante.<|endoftext|>Torres to lead off the 3rd.<|endoftext|>First is good.<|endoftext|>I put two units on the Dolphins for the second half. They are -3 so they must tie or win.<|endoftext|>Yang supports the dreamers, but his campaign is a nightmare. Will sell this joke to any late-night host of the price is right.<|endoftext|>Top of the 9th, bases loaded with 2 away. Red Sox up by one and hoping to pad that lead.<|endoftext|>And another first serve point for Bautista. Tsitsipas challenged and failed.<|endoftext|>Norm Macdonald is your Ultimate Stand-Up Comic via @forthewin<|endoftext|>But you must admit the subway can be scary with those marauding bands of hedge-fund managers wilding their way through the a-train.<|endoftext|>Hits Maldonado and runners at first and second now.<|endoftext|>DEVER KICKS A FG AND TAKES THE LEAD<|endoftext|>2nd and goal and facemark call and this will mean a TD for the HAWKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>So that explains why cash is 4 bucks credit is 5 bucks. Except it don't.<|endoftext|>I decide to watch all the comedy specials and I noticed that the comedians fall in 2 categories. Way overpaid (nearly all), way underpaid (nearly none). Interestingly the comedian who may be the most underpaid is The Peerless One, Chappelle.<|endoftext|>I am sweating a huge bet on a huge dog, the great @rumnchess. I played with this man twice in tourneys. When I saw he was deep I came down to the Rio and when not in an event, was on his rail.<|endoftext|>BAMA TD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 28-0<|endoftext|>What a guy.<|endoftext|>No. he crushes a deep liner to right. Crowd is silent.<|endoftext|>Skins stop them but the clock will run down to 20 seconds before the punt.<|endoftext|>IT SLIDES BY!!!!!!!!!!!! And a disappointing result for a very well-crafted hole by Tiger.<|endoftext|>Well underway on the final day. I took Im after the second round when he was 140-1 and he made a great comeback and is playing with DJ and 4 back. Cameron Smith s the player I predicted pre-tourney at 36-1. I laid off DJ because of his problem finishing. I am very very nervous.<|endoftext|>I have deep respect for both @normhiscock and for @suecostello. I will not say a word against either, as I know both to be good fine people. There are many others in comedy that I think are unfunny and, furthermore, malicious. But I should never be allowed to silence them. Peace.<|endoftext|>There is a flag in the secondary, and that might be a clue as to how that receiver got so wide-open. Let's listen.<|endoftext|>Alice, I disagree with your hypothesis. First of all, being racist does not make you "relevant". Ironically, you are actually the irrelevant for believing precisely what your grandfather believed. Thhink about it, Alice. How does your white supremacy make you "stylish"?<|endoftext|>A perfectly played hole by Koepka, who is at -8.<|endoftext|>And all of a sudden everything backwards. You start to feel like you're the guy putting the elbow on HIM and maybe you even start saying why you need the money. And that sour taste gets worse and you recognize it for what it is. It is unfair is what it is.<|endoftext|>Pitch is in the dirt and gets away, Kinsler takes third.<|endoftext|>So they’re getting ready for the face off. Only 2:49 to go to get to the halfway mark of this game. If it remains at 1-0, I’m ready to call the under a win.<|endoftext|>Such a great compliment, Taylor. Peace.<|endoftext|>And Tsitsipas wins another long one to even the set at 4.<|endoftext|>Here’s how it went down. Loosing player raises pre-flop. I’m the only caller with A-10 diamonds. Comes up A-Q-4. I check call the flip the turn and the river. Raiser shows me A-K<|endoftext|>In group 21, teeing off at 11:30 EST, is the 3rd of my 4-tee pool. Talking bout Senior superstar, Phil "Lefty" Mickelson.<|endoftext|>All right, as promised, an update on Fritelli. He has now finished his round and will begin his second round soon. He has. a share of the lead at -7. Guess who else has that score and will play alongside. It is Dustin Johnson. Be interesting to see.<|endoftext|>Tiger is having one of his greatest rounds ever at Muirfield. And it could be even better. He began the day 11 shots back. He's completed12.He has no bogies and and incredible 7 birdies through 12, and he missed short ones at 9 and 10. Amazing. From 11backto 4 back.<|endoftext|>Next Mark is The 7 minutes left.<|endoftext|>in the dirt. 1-2.<|endoftext|>And Patrick Reed sticks his approach shot so that will be the final stiletto to take DeChambeau out of this. Of course, he would have bodied the final hole anyway. Hope you took my advice and ignored the experts. Peace.<|endoftext|>Wentz to Jeffrey. Incomplete. So the FG attempt, with that 5 yard false start penalty, will be of the 54 yard variety.<|endoftext|>Ensan and Sammartino are heads-up for the Main Event bracelet.<|endoftext|>Inside 3-0. So Judge will be watching this one the whole way.<|endoftext|>Haha. My friends who consume books in this way say that the narrator is key.<|endoftext|>Follows with a first serve win. 30-30<|endoftext|>Gregorius comes to the plate now.<|endoftext|>@sp9659 that would be fantastic<|endoftext|>And Woods comes out of his shoes but leave it right, just like the first hole. He is in the green side bunker and will need to get it up and down for birdie.<|endoftext|>Tiger, at the par 5 second and bombs it well over 300 yards.<|endoftext|>@ColinCowherd @TheHerd It’s a brilliant point. Bring it up on the show, pallie. Put my tweets up on the big board!!! Respect.<|endoftext|>Bottom of the same inning and the Astros hard men did the same, scoring 1 and cutting the lead in half.<|endoftext|>I found the fight but now I can't find the UFC fights. I have Spectrum in LA and they are saying it is on ESPN Plus???? Anybody?<|endoftext|>And for those who are still awake here in the States we have seen Tsitsipas survive an unrelenting attack by Federer. It has been just short of 2 hours and he has yet to succumb. and for all that time, only one set has been decided.<|endoftext|>There are so few people I have wanted to meet in person, but my job has allowed me to meet some but not all. I met my comic hero David Letterman, my stand-up heroes, Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Sam Kinison, Bob Newhart, who I actually was lucky enough to write a bit for his act.<|endoftext|>Tiger wi5h a tricky putt from the edge of the bunker misses and leaves himself a 5 footer.<|endoftext|>I’m down to 35K<|endoftext|>The "experts" all calling it an awful putt.<|endoftext|>its 5-4 now as Tsitsipas takes his first lead of the match and Bautista will now serve to survive here in Set number 1.<|endoftext|>@DrewBarrymore Congratulations, Drew. This show will be awesome!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Djoko kept Rafa on the baseline and then seven shots in took it shallow to the line and in by a hair.<|endoftext|>After the stretch, the Brewers go down quietly and things do not get easier for Jeffress here in the top of the 8th as he faces the top of the order, and it is Taylor, who is 0 for 3 today.<|endoftext|>Wow!!!! Just read about the suicide note left next to the body of Jeff Epstein. "Jeffrey will be unable to face these baseless charges, as he no longer is." signed Epstein's Mother.<|endoftext|>only a few events left in this year's WSOP, and the wrist still bare but the dreams unbroken, only deferred a year.<|endoftext|>And a breaking ball makes it 00-2.<|endoftext|>And now it is first down and Rivers on the march. This will be a very big possession.<|endoftext|>There'll be some news soon concerning the book being reprinted as soon as another announcement is made. For now, I think there are a few hardcovers left which I am custom-signing. Be assured that none of the money goes to me.<|endoftext|>Another great punt by Dixon, who is touching this ball as much as anybody on the Giants.<|endoftext|>I love you, too, pallie. Keep up the good work.<|endoftext|>And, right now, that decision to fill the bases is the difference in this game.<|endoftext|>Ball a the 30 is handed to Smallwood who takes it to the 25 yard line as the warning happens in The Meadowlands.<|endoftext|>Kawaii makes a TIGER-SHOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>No. Should I, then?<|endoftext|>A big game for me tonight. I am tied for second in the pool with two others the tiebreaker is the total. I have the worst collective total for the entire league, so for the season I will have to win outright. Every week moving up the leaderboard, now in 3rd, 90-70.<|endoftext|>Verlander gives up a hit on his very first pitch to Mookie Betts.<|endoftext|>Very frustrating. My cable provider is Spectrum in L.A. and I can't find a way to order the Pacquio fight. If any of you guys have any idea, let me know. I do not want to get it on my computer. I want to order it on TV. Thanks.Much appreciated.<|endoftext|>Fleetwood with another great approach shot at the second and if he can start this Sunday with birdie-birdie, watch out.<|endoftext|>Join me in my hunger strike (only after consulting a physician)!!! Together we can make a difference!! #FreeFelicity<|endoftext|>@hunterbrynn21 Hunter-brynn, why do you get angry at the great Mark Hamill for tweeting. e's a great actor and a great American. Why do you think someone should take his phone, for goodness sake?<|endoftext|>They were creased leather, and there was always a blister either healing or freshly just-got. And Brucky, she'd laugh that wheeze of a laugh she had that's kill her four years later, and tell me she'd see what she could do and go to that carousel and come back with a nice fat one<|endoftext|>Thanks so much, Brody. I am so happy you enjoyed the greatest comic novel ever written, and I am hopeful you spread the word of it far and wide.<|endoftext|>AND HE SURVIVES IT!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>I did amateur night in a club called Yuk-Yuks in Ottawa, Canada and afterwards I left, deciding I would never do stand-up comedy again. The manager, Howie Wagman, actually chased me down Sparks Street.<|endoftext|>Mama with a sack faces 2nd and 16.<|endoftext|>Up high and swings. Just got a piece off it. Remains 1-2.<|endoftext|>Tiger at 14 with a fine approach but gets a tough break and the ball backs up off the green.<|endoftext|>@HowardTNY I always felt the speech was impersonal. I know Downey's cadence. I knew the speech couldn't be generic. it had to be an incident, which leads to the jarring epiphany of what he's become in the eyes of others. Downey's brilliant contribution was his reaction to the windfall.<|endoftext|>Houston pulls to within 3 with two out in the seventh. BOSTON LEADS 4-1!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>And what a story this is becoming for Johnson, as well as Adrian Peterson.<|endoftext|>Top of the order now for Porcello. His pitch count is 27. 23 have been strikes.<|endoftext|>TIGERS APPROACH AT THE PAR 5 IS PIN HIGH!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE WILL BE PUTTIN FOR EAGLE TO JOIN THE LEADERS!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Machado had to make an exceptional slide where he slid past the plate and then reached back with his hand to tag. Watch the replay when they show it. Extraordinary.<|endoftext|>@bird_whistler Did you get that message?Let me know if you have further problems and keep me posted on how it works for you.<|endoftext|>Tony Kemp at the plate now.<|endoftext|>Wilson throws to the end zone to Baldwin and it is overthrown. BIG BIG PLAY COMING UP NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Porcello with his 63rd pitch and it is fouled off. Still feels like Hicks will prevail here.<|endoftext|>Kem fouls it off and a full count now.<|endoftext|>I pressed. Under 2nd half. Clippers second half.<|endoftext|>I predicted extra-innings a long time ago and it looks like I'll be correct.<|endoftext|>TD SOONERS!!!!!!!!!!!!! and they should go for 2.<|endoftext|>If you were advising Biden? You know presidential hopefuls don't go to hack entertainment reporters, right Bill? I love Joe and he'll be just fine without your help, moron. And "flagging acuity"? I thought you were a writer? Check your OED.<|endoftext|>The big blind tomorrow will begin at 3 million and the antes match. So Sammartino, with every orbit costing 7 million, 10 percent of his stack, will have to get involved early. Best-case scenario for @rumnchess is obviously to knock out Samartyino early. but not easy. here's why.<|endoftext|>Top of the third and the lead-off man, Puig,pounds it right back to the mound and Gonzales knocks the ball down with his glove and as he comes off the mound to field the ball, he turns his ankle. Puig is at first and Gonzales is trying to walk off this ankle injury.<|endoftext|>And first play of the. game has Rogers hooking up with Davante Adams and he is in Indy territory.<|endoftext|>I assure you I, Captain Midnight, am not a robot, but I cannot say the same of Wolf BlitzerSLX500 -Captain Midnight #YangGang<|endoftext|>Rafa serves down 4-2.<|endoftext|>Up at the green on 13, Smith looks over his birdie try from 15 feet. It will have a big left-to right break. He birdied the first three days and, when he needed it, missed. The smart play now would be for DJ to lay-up. And he lays up.<|endoftext|>And now Rafe will have to dig deep here. He must stop Djoko and he must stop him now!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Verlander is pitching his 80th here in the top of the 6th.<|endoftext|>its first and goal and the run is FOR 0 YARDS!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>SAMMARTINO MAKES THE CALL!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>Watches this one all the way and it is very close but called ball 4 and it is Hill's third walk.<|endoftext|>Pass to the 20.<|endoftext|>Djoko serves, a backspin return by Rafa, Djoko to to the near quadrant, Rafa goes deep to the baseline, Djoko in the middle and right to a waiting Nadal who fires it to the cross-line. AND JUST MISSES!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>3rd and 6 and Goff throws for 6. first and goal.<|endoftext|>Gurriel is up and he watches 3 straight balls. One more and the tying run is in the on-deck circle for the third straight inning.<|endoftext|>A ground ball finds a hole and a base hit. And another pitching change as Puig comes to the plate.<|endoftext|>That's so kind. By the way, I am getting the last of the hardcovers because they only print softcovers now. May keep them for investment. May sell some. stay tuned.<|endoftext|>Running every play now. Remember a FG by the Vikes changes nothing. It is a double loss.<|endoftext|>On the river nothing to help Gates and he exits 4th. And, boy, you will never see this kind of reaction for a player who comes in 4th. A devastating day for Gates, who will be A gentleman but make no mistake. Gates is in incredible pain.<|endoftext|>Again if they score 7 on the first possession they will have 2m minutes or so to catch up from a 2 possession game.<|endoftext|>And the Giants have to be very disappointed to end that drive with only 3 points. Only Barkley is keeping New York in this game.<|endoftext|>@pattonoswalt Thank you, @pattonoswalt. We will never leave the road.<|endoftext|>Chronicles was a piece of art.<|endoftext|>@dcarterruff Hell. Thank you for remembering, David.

There are 100 players. I am in 10th place, 7 games back of the leader. It is always huge to win the Thursday game. I have been awful with Thursdays.<|endoftext|>Pushes it wide. And if you want to call that good news for The Giants, then there you go. First half is done and the Eagles lead 24-6.<|endoftext|>HITS IT DEEP DEEP DEEP!!!!!! BUT CAUGHT AT THE WARNING TRACK!!!!!!! WOW!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>@tspicchiali @MitchMossRadio @paulyhoward It was a great tip. Wasn't sure how confidential it was supposed to be.<|endoftext|>It is being reviewed.<|endoftext|>Bryson at 17 and he has left it right and this is the last thing he needed.
